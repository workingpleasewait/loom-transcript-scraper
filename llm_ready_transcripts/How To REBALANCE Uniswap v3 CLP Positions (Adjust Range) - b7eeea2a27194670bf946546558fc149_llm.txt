[0:00]So there's two different ways that I use to actually adjust the range or I should say rebalance my uniswab v3 Concentrated according to the positions So let's hop into those the first one is obviously the normal way And this is how most people end up doing it the second way is going to be a way more[0:15]efficient way as well as this going to be cheaper and theres no fees associated with it so the first way were just going to head over to uniswab we are going to remove our liquidity now when we remove our liquidity it is going to claim our matic and its going to claim our wrapped bitcoin in this case[0:28]scenario its matic and wrapped bitcoin because this is matic and wrapped bitcoin pool the point is when we remove our liquidity its going to collect our fees its also going to give us this ratio of assets so right here we have 2813 matic thats the amount of matic were getting out of this pool were also[0:43]getting an additional 341 from our fees over here we have.31b btc or i should say wbtc were getting that plus this.008 wbtc as well but we would just simply go over to remove liquidity we want to remove all of our liquidity so we would put max or 100% and then from here we would click remove and then[1:03]it would prompt our wallet and here we would simply sign the transaction in our wallet you can see this is our output of assets now of course if we want to compound our earnings what we can do is we can take this number which is $16,711 and just copy that and then of course we would go over to builder[1:20]metrics and find the same exact pool and we would enter in our new range and put in our dollar deposit so for example this one is wrapped bitcoin on the polygon network paired with matic so i'm gonna go and find the exact same pool which is this one right here and then i'm gonna enter in my new range[1:36]so say i enter in my new range its something like this lets just say and then i have you know 16,711 dollars that i exited with keep in mind thats including the fees its gonna tell me i need this much matic and this much wrapped bitcoin so im gonna go over to a platform like swapdefilama. com and im simply[1:54]gonna trade the excess assets so when we go back over were actually getting the majority of our money out in bitcoin right? [2:01]Well now we need to swap some of that bitcoin from matic right? Because we have.31 wbtc but in this case scenario we only need.16 wbtc and we 9500 matic so were gonna go and were gonna swap that amount of wbtc for matic little bit of a pain and then after we do that we would just simply click create[2:19]position and open up a brand new position with that range with those assets if you dont want a compound you would simply select the fees and you remove your liquidity and the amount you get from removing your liquidity But the easiest possible way that you can do it is by heading over to Aputure Finance[2:44]. This is a liquidity management tool that allows you to automatically rebalance your positions and rebalance with ease. We want to go to advanced liquidity management with intent driven uni v3 tools. [2:55]Here we will find our position. Now one thing I want to mention if we want to not compound our fees so we don't want to compound our fees we are going to click collect fees and collect our fees before we execute this rebalance because when we click rebalance over here we are going to automatically be[3:10]compounding our fees so we would put in our new range right here let's just say I calculated a range of 34,116 so I'll paste that in and then my max price is right over here I'd paste that in as well it's going to simulate and say hey this is how much matic I'll have and this is how much wrapped bitcoin[3:27]I'll have you'll take a look over at builder metrics and say hey this is very very similar you click rebalance now and what this is essentially going to do is 3 different things number 1 exit your current position number 2 execute a swap to get those assets in the proper ratio and then number 3 enter[3:44]into a new position and when you sign the permission permit there will be an option to rebalance the position click rebalance and then it will open up a brand new position so it's easy as that with aperture whereas if you you know want to do that manually you have to go over to uniswap position remove[4:00]your liquidity execute the trade to get to the proper asset ratio and of course enter a brand new position aperture does all of that in one transaction which ultimately saves you gas cost and there is no fee for rebalancing on aperture at the current moment.
