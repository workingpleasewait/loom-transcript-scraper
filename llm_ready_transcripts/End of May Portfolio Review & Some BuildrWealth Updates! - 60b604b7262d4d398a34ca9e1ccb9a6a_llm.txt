[00:00]Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and do a portfolio update. I'm back, better than ever. I'm excited to be back, basically, and dive back into things. [00:07]And I'm glad that I haven't got completely killed with my portfolio while I was taking about a week break over here. [00:13]But, basically, over on Beefy, we got OVN to USD+. This one is killing it now, right? OVN has started to go back up. [00:20]So, if we go ahead and take a look over at the 7-day chart, it looks pretty sexy. And if we look at one month, once again, it does not look too good right there whatsoever. [00:28]But, going back up, and I'm excited that we are going back up there. So, that essentially took me from $54.28 to $5,095. [00:36]So, I'm down $3.32 from price, but $4.88 from earnings. That puts me at approximately, profit loss of roughly $155 basically. [00:44]Right? So, do keep that in mind. And if we dive into this actual position over here, you'll notice my initial deposit, $49.50. [00:50]Right? And I have about $400, nearly $500 in overall earnings, but my total deposit is about $54.50. That's because these earnings are compounded. [01:00]So, the way that I'm tracking this, I'm using the TJ template, and I am basically just throwing in, um, US dollars. [01:06]Right? Because that's what BP shows me. Uh, granted it would be great to see how much was collected in terms of OBN, and how much was collected in terms of USD plus, and then log that over here. [01:16]But at the same exact time, I could just take this dollar amount right there, and I could just paste that over where it says USD plus fees, and it's a lot easier, and it does not mess up the metrics or anything. [01:25]Um, so yeah, current is $5,095, but I started with $4,950, so I'm at basically $150 profit right there. Uh, and that's because the earnings are really helping me out. [01:35]If I had no earnings, I would actually be down roughly $335 bucks, basically, just from the price of But, I'm glad this is doing good. [01:42]It's doing 180% APR. Once again, OVN is a pretty solid asset. Really love the platform. I used to use them back in the day, back when they were like partners with Spear Finance and all those guys and stuff like that. [01:53]Back when they had $10-15 million TVL, and now, they're completely killing it. They have $30 million of TVL in OVN to USD plus. [02:00]Not even on their actual stablecoin itself. So, that's a really good position for me. And, you know, in my personal opinion, if I wanted to hold stablecoins, I would go and I would hold money on Overnight Finance, because I'm holding stablecoins while earning yield, basically. [02:14]It's doing about 17.3%, which is not too bad whatsoever. And then, they also have like ETH, where you can earn about 3.5%. [02:20]They go and they stake it through a couple different derivatives right there. But yeah, that one's obviously carrying my portfolio. [02:26]I have ETHlink over here, which is also doing really, really good. I'm super glad that I switched out of MATIC link into ETHlink, because over here, I'm up $2,000. [02:36]$2,000 from the price appreciating, right? Now, keep in mind, when we dive into ETHlink, MATIC link over here, I was actually down, or actually it's LINKMATIC, I was down roughly $3,400 over here, $1,200 there, and I was up like $1,500 over here. [02:51]So, I'm just kind of making that money back as the price goes back up. But I got $350 in earnings right here, practically no impermanent loss, that's a 10% impermanent loss ratio. [03:00]Right there, I have 10 extra earnings that I have impermanent loss, really, really good ratio right there, and it's killing it. [03:06]And I'm up $2,400 overall, puts me at a 10% profit, been deployed for about a week, and doing about 65% APR. [03:12]So, once again, it is not the sexiest return, 65%, a lot of people will say, oh that sucks, but keep in mind, what do you get in the stock market, on average? [03:20]About 10, 12% per year. What do you get in real estate? About 15% a year. What do you get on your cash? [03:26]About 4, 5% a year, right? 60%, 65%, that's killer, right? We're just used to, obviously, these crazy 1% per day APRs, and remember, in my personal opinion, I think it's great to have those 1% a day things, or those high yield things. [03:40]Things that you're taking a little bit more risk with, but then also have the stuff where you're taking less risk with, and that's the majority of your portfolio, and you're doing that with assets you truly believe in and truly want to hold.
