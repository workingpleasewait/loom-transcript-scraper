[00:00]So as part of my efforts to keep you guys up to date with what I'm currently doing in the decentralized finance space, I'm going to be posting more exclusive content just like this. [00:08]Today I'm going to break down my 65% APR DeFi Passive Income portfolio. Currently has roughly $46,400 invested into it, currently at an overall profit of roughly 5.27%, but I do want to go and mention that a good portion of these positions are completely market neutral, and the other portion is just[00:26]simply blue chip assets. So let's go and hop into it. Now I'm going to make a dedicated video on this tracking sheet in just a little bit. [00:32]Uhh, probably within the next few days, but this is since she has all of my DeFi passive income positions in it, as well as it has all of my hodl positions in it for this specific portfolio. [00:42]Obviously I have stuff over on Coinbase, the big big hodl portfolios over on Coinbase, but I do have about $40,000. [00:48]Uhh, and hodls, just on my DeFi wallet that I'm holding on the same exact wallet address, and that's exactly why these are included in here as well. [00:56]Uhh, because these are kind of the positions that I want to track, something I'm dollar cost averaging in, I'm just not going to bother including it, because a lot of the times that's a set of and forget it, these are the ones that I monitor. [01:05]But the first position we have, I've been in for roughly 73 days, and this is Ethereum to Ethereum Plus on Archimedes Finance. [01:13]Now, Archimedes Finance acts as an aggregator, I guess you could say, for curve finance, RF finance as well as convex finance. [01:21]Now, full disclaimer, they did pay me one Ethereum to deposit into this pool just to kind of test out to see how this pool does, so far I've had absolutely no complaints. [01:30]It's held up to roughly an 11% APR. If we compare that to what I get, stake in Ethereum, currently getting roughly 3.5% stake in Ethereum. [01:37]But with that being said, there is a decent amount of risk getting it into the Archimedes platform itself, because it's relatively low TVL, it's, you know, different smart contracts, something that hasn't been proven in the past, so there is the risk of exploit, which is why I haven't just gone and thrown[01:51]my whole Ethereum bag into this portfolio. But the other thing I want to go and mention is I also have roughly $14,000 of wrapped-staked Ethereum. [01:58]I've earned roughly $540 on that wrapped-staked Ethereum, but I'm up overall of $5.3k, so nearly up 2x on that stash, which would be amazing. [02:08]I do want to mention my average body. And it was very dramatic and I bought some more at like 60 cents or 70 cents or so so I did kind of get spread out around the board there but I am glad to be up. [02:34]My steak Dave ax is doing really well. I have not been in this position for a long time, roughly 45 days or maybe even less than that. [02:41]But I deployed roughly $1,500 of capital into this position. It's now worth $5,000. That's a really good return. It's over 3x on what I invested into it. [02:51]My soul stash is up pretty much 2x from here. Gio, I don't expect that to go too far because it's collateralized. [02:57]By stable coins. But I am borrowing against this Gio. And other thing I want to go and mention, all of these assets right here, I am borrowing against. [03:05]Except my MSL. Haven't got to that one quite yet. But I'm borrowing against my Rapstick Ethereum. I'm borrowing against my MaticX. [03:10]I'm borrowing against my Staked Avax. I'm borrowing against my Gio. Through cooler loans. Interest free loan. No liquidations. And I'm also borrowing against my Rap Bitcoin. [03:18]These other assets, they're just smaller bags, which is why I'm not borrowing against them. But by borrowing against all these assets, I'm able to create this market neutral portfolio with USDC, USDT positions on Orca, as well as Trader Joe. [03:30]But also an LUSD to USDC position in Aerodrome. So let's go further into those. But I do want to mention this only uses the previous 24 hours worth of volume. [03:50]And as you can see I have roughly 98 40 here with $20 in pending yield So let me go ahead and take a look at my spreadsheet. [03:56]It's gonna be this one highlighted right here I entered this one roughly three and a half days ago, but so far I've made 20 bucks in earnings $4 in price appreciation we're not really counting that but my APR is 22% that's because some days it is higher than other days which is allowing me to get this
