[0:00]Hey guys, gonna go ahead and kick off this channel by posting about Kamino finance project that I've been looking into for a while Quick little recap this channel is for anyone and everyone to post different DeFi platforms that they come across So we can all share our thoughts on it give tips and tricks[0:14]stuff like that for example somebody may come across Kamino and say hey like I don't like that platform because of this and it opens my eyes on why I shouldn't like Kamino or why I should tell them why I like Kamino but with that being said Kamino is a pretty interesting protocol looking at overall Solana[0:30]DeFi there's a TVL of 633 million dollars now Kamino has about 28 million dollars of that TVL basically so you can argue Kamino makes up for roughly five percent of overall Solana DeFi was a pretty substantial market share another thing I want to go and mention though is marinade financing has a TVL[0:49]of 558 million dollars. That's the top DeFi protocol on Solana Network. There's judo that has a TVL of 390 million dollars but both of these protocols are liquid staking protocols where essentially you can stake your soul so they're not really considered true DeFi protocols where you can provide liquidity[1:06]and stuff like that. There's also MargenFi which is a Linden and Baran platform. Once again, I don't know if you want to include that or not. [1:14]Getting some actual protocols like Solend as well as Orca, Radium. Orca, Radium are the top decentralized exchanges on Solend. Solena network and Camino finance uses those decentralized exchanges. [1:25]So I like to say Camino is like the aperture finance, the beefy finance as well as the gamma strategies of Solena network because essentially you can go and deposit into managed vaults just like you could over on beefy finance. [1:37]Right? We could go over to let's just say USDC to USDH right here and we could deposit right into it just like that. [1:45]It's gonna do everything for us. We don't have to do anything whatsoever. It's also going to show us a lot of analytics right over here just like gamma is going to show us. [1:53]Kind of beefy finance as well as gamma strategies combined in this aspect. With that being said, if you don't like that strategy. [2:00]So for example, over here, I'm going to go ahead and find a strategy that I kind of like we have sold to USDC. [2:06]This is a 60% APR right now, which is pretty nice. 177k of TVL in this pool, which is pretty good with $2.54 million of volume and this was hosted on radian. [2:18]If we go over here to deposit, we could go and look at the analytics and we could pretty much see the Camino strategy if we just held. [2:25]If we held 100% soul or if we held 100% USDC. So as you can see, the Camino strategy is up 20%. [2:32]If we just held our initial soul in our initial USDC, we would be up 30%. And if we just held all of our money in soul, we'd be up 78%. [2:39]So obviously Camino strategy is being outperformed. You need to take that into account. Now with that being said, maybe there's an issue with the range because this is automatically managed. [2:48]Well then we can go back over to liquidity, we can click create a vault and from here we can have our own soul the USDC vault. [2:54]So that being said, we do soul USDC on Orca. Let's just say it's on the 0.05% fee tier right here. [3:01]And then we go down a little bit further. Instead of using like a fixed range, we might use something called tracker. [3:06]And this is since you can attract the price of social constantly adjust our liquidity. So that being said for my men price, I might put something like negative 15% maybe because I think soul has limited downside exposure for my max price. [3:19]I might put something like plus 25% because I think soul has a lot of upside exposure. Now looking at this, I might want to do negative 10% just to give a better ratio. [3:30]70% in soul and 32% in USDC. We go over here. We can back test this over the past seven days. [3:37]So when you look at this over the past seven days, we would have collected 2.52% in overall fees. Annualized that's 263%. [3:46]Is great. Our profit loss against USD or sorry, our profit loss against USD would be negative 4.5% because soul has seen a decline.
