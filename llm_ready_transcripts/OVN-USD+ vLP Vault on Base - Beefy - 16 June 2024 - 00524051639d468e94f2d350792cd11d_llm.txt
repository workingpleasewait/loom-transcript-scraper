[0:00]Hey team, so I just want to go ahead and get you guys up to speed with what I'm currently invested into So I have about a $45,000 allocation on Uniswap And over here are my concentrated liquidity positions So I have $33,000 that is invested into this Ethereum to link position right here And this is doing[0:18]about a 55% APR. So it comes out to about $50 per day, pretty happy with that, so far that's been relatively consistent Um, I did just rebalance this to a relatively tight range So if we go ahead and open this up over here Uh, you'll notice, if I adjust that calculation range to 30 days Somewhat of a[0:33]tight range, I do have an Aperture Auto Rebalance right over here So do keep that in mind Um, that rebalances to make sure I stay in range Obviously, uh, and you know, essentially what it does is whenever the price goes to a specific point It'll just rebalance to a broad range, so that way I have time[0:48]to go in there, adjust it It locks in a little impermanent loss, but it makes sure that there's not going to be crazy impermanent loss in the future Because I do have a broad range, this one is on Ethereum mainnet, keep that in mind And then over here I have Ethereum to spec And then on Ethereum to spec[1:02], this one is similar concept, right? I have that tighter range basically, at least in my opinion I might even go even tighter, but then basically whenever, you know, it's starting to get to a specific point It'll automatically rebalance that using Aperture Finance, pay a very, very small fee, keep it[1:18]in check, lock in a little Impermanent Loss, but make sure it's not locking in further in the future, that's the real goal, uhm, of this position, and that's kind of like what I did with that first spec position, had a super tight range, earned some killer yield, right? [1:31]Had some Impermanent Loss, it rebalanced, and then boom, that rebalance saved me, so that way I didn't have crazy Impermanent Loss, and then boom, I was, I was chillin' basically, uhm. [1:40]and I collected more yield, and still did a really good APR, so this is showing, uh, over here on the strategize page, roughly 62 hours per day, which is pretty accurate, about 188% APR, pretty happy with that, so off $45,000, collectively doing about 91% return, and that's about 112 bucks per day, and[1:58]then over here on BP Finance, I have this OVM in the USDC, or USD plus one, sorry, and this is about.74% per day, and I'm up $750 on this one right now, which is 11%, which is great, so $1,000 in yield so far, that's 17% of the position, had a little bit of a capital loss, but when we do the math, that's[2:14]7, 7,600 basically, times 0.75 percent. Which is about $57 per day, so when we add that over here, basically coming out to about, you know, $170 per day, which I'm pretty happy with, $170 per day, that is basically $62,000 per year, which is about what I have deployed, so I'm, I'm $9,500 per day. [2:43]I'll keep you guys updated on the portfolio, I'm doing a little bit more of a blue chip portfolio right now, mainly because the market's uncertain, it's a very weird market this cycle around basically, so that's why I have $33K in Ethereum to link, this spec one is, you know, a medium risk position, [2:54]leaning more towards the higher risk, and then, uh, that OV into USD plus one is also a higher risk position, so my plan is over here on OV into USD plus, to start pulling out some profit pretty soon, and then my plan over here on, uh, Ethereum to spec is to collect all the fees basically, as profit, [3:13]so, yeah, that's the current strategy.
