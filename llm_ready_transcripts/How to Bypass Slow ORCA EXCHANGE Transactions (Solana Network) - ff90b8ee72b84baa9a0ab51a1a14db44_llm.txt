[0:00]Hey guys I just want to go ahead and break down kind of some issues I guess with this law and that work so typically when you're trying to execute transactions on an orca you're going to run into a lot of issues right now because the network of slon is so congested. [0:13]So typically this is the page v1. work it up. So slash the quantity that you're managing your liquidity at so once I connect my wallet which keep in mind this page is very very glitchy as you can see I hit connect wallet and it took like 10 seconds to connect my wallet. [0:27]Uh but let's just say I want to exit this pipe right because I do because the yield completely sucks. Now, looking at over here at this pipe pool you can see that I'm currently on this V tier 0.3% and over here. [0:40]Well 0.3% is where 64% of the liquidity is. There's also 35% over on the 0.05%. So let's just confirm that this sucks. [0:48]Right? The main reason why is because I want to make sure that it's not just the 24 hour yield that sucks. [0:53]Um, but overall that's just been not doing so hot recently. I can do that by just plopping it into builder metrics. [0:59]So I'll go ahead and throw in my range essentially and what ended up happening with pipe is you can see there's a huge block of liquid in the right there because of that huge block of liquid that I'm getting horrible returns. [1:10]So regardless, I'm either going to go in with a tighter range on this pool. I'm just going to get into a different pool. [1:14]Have it quite decided yet. Um, but you can see this gets me roughly 20% per year and that's even including Thank you. [1:20]These days where we have super high volume and we go ahead and bring down this calculation range to recently 6% per year. [1:26]So pretty accurate whether it's showing on an orca right now because of this huge block of liquid. So basically I'm going to go ahead and exit this pool. [1:32]We'll have it over to orca. We'll go over here to a draw. on. We'll go ahead to burn this NFT for the position. [1:39]Now I'm just going to go ahead and take a screenshot of like the position details right here. So that way I know how much pie it is as well as how much so I hit withdraw and then what's going to end up happening is this transaction is just never going to go through. [1:52]So I just went ahead and confirmed the transaction on my ledger and you can see it's saying confirm in and we could wait here for like an hour and this will eventually just say it timed out and it didn't go through or whatever it may be. [2:04]So the solution that I'm proposing is actually using the I guess V2. What they call it, a VORCA. It's literally work it out so slash equality as opposed to being V1 dot work out dot so slash equality. [2:15]Um and then over here they have their own little terminal for managing liquidity. Now granted it's still going to be slow just not as slow and that really confuses me mainly for the reason that it's interacting with the same exact smart contract so I don't know if I've just kind of had luck with using[2:30]this liquidity terminal over here or if it's actually like you know faster for whatever reason but whenever I go over here to portfolio number one is going to show you all your positions right here. [2:39]Um so we could go over this pipe to sole position uh and we can hit remove liquidity and when we hit that we would then go and hit max. [2:47]We want to remove both assets and then hit close positions and they'll go ahead and remove my liquidity. Now I'm going to go ahead and wait for this one to fail. [2:54]So I've literally been waiting here for about five minutes and this is not going through. So I'm just going to go ahead and exit out of this and if we go over here you know the transaction is just not going through. [3:03]It's really really annoying over here. So next thing I'm going to do I'm going to head over to orka. so portfolio liquidity terminal basically. [3:10]I'm just going to hit close position right here and to show you how to do that once again we're just going to go over to the position. [3:15]This pipe stole hit a little three dots and hit remove liquidity once again I'll hit max and then I'll hit close position. [3:22]I'm going to reason. I mean this isn't fast either but it goes through compared to I'm not having any luck on the overall or on the other Orca page so pretty interesting stuff.
