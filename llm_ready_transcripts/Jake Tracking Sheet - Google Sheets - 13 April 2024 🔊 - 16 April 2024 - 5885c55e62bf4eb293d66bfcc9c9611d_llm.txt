[0:00]You guys probably do not hear this term a lot but the power of diamond hands is very, very important. So you gotta be able to disconnect sometimes and just kind of block out the noise, block out like all that stuff. [0:13]Because I posted this video three days ago in the position update in feedback section and basically I just said hey, I lost a ton, a ton of money. [0:21]Actually not really lost but I'm down a ton of money because I was in these positions and then the market just completely crashed. [0:27]Now am I gonna go ahead and do an update? Now keep in mind I am not at profits in these positions but I am at better states than I was at before basically. [0:36]So first things first, I wanna take a look over this linkmatic one. This linkmatic one was down 3700, uhh I had two bucks in permanent loss, down 3.9 from price, 150 of earnings, currently thinkmatic is down, uhh roughly 4.4 so a little bit more, right? [0:52]Uhh but again that in permanent loss, staying right in that like 22 dollar range or something like that. Uhh and 20 bucks is nothing when we're looking at the overall capital deployed here. [1:02]Uhh however those earnings are consistently billed. And that APR is relatively low at 32%. I would say this position is beating in permanent loss but it is one of the lower returning positions. [1:12]And something that I noticed since I have so much in permanent loss in this position, I could actually narrow it in the range, keep the same exact asset ratio so that way I don't really lock in. [1:21]And then get a higher yield which will help me recoup some of that loss. And of course when assets rise, as long as they are correlated in value, I am making my initial principle back. [1:29]So that is one thing right there. Umm, ETH RINDER. ETH RINDER got hit pretty hard as well. Uh this ETH RINDER is doing way better now. [1:38]So if we go ahead and take a look at that video, uh ETH RINDER had 405 bucks in terminal loss, $1,500 of overall loss right there, and then also roughly $170 in earnings. [1:48]That puts me at negative $1,400. If I go ahead and look at what I'm currently at right now on that negative $170 on ETH RINDER because I have 370 in earnings, and I only have 42 bucks in lost so I went completely back in range at one point. [2:01]This was actually out of range now it's back in range my thought process is here like hey maybe I'll wait a little bit uh till I rebalance and then I'll rebalance to something that's a little bit broader that way I can encapsulate like if the price like kind of shoots shoots up again in one of those[2:17]specific assets or shoots down again I guess in one of those specific assets either. Um B&B FET this one is down 1670 looking back over here looks like B&B FET was down 1620 so not much of a change there. [2:30]Umm, looking over at this 1960s so some of these numbers actually kind of look worse what I want to go and mention is they were a lot worse than this because I recorded this you know basically 1pm on Saturday April 13th Sunday it got worse man it got completely killed the market got killed. [2:56]so these positions like were collectively down like you know 8.5k in this video they were down like 10 11k you know at worst case scenario so what I wanted to mention is we're doing a lot better than kind of win that that period was there I know some people exited their LPs at that period of time. [3:12]I was just holding out mainly because I know like hey these assets going to shoot back up eventually world coin is about the same it's down 1900 over here currently down like 1880 or 1890 over here but once again this was at one point in time down like 3k so diamond hands you know I am hoping you know[3:30]leading up to the having we are going to see some price movement and like these positions will retrace to get back into range and get back into actual profit but for the most part I'm just holding these out right now I'm not too worried I know this long term game umm and remember the basis of our strategy[3:45]is to put assets you want to hold in the portfolio in lp's and then earn the income on those assets and while not all these positions are earning income cause like mad at qstc as well as ethworldcoin those are out of range the other ones are earning income and sometimes it is important to not earn that[4:01]income if it means not locking in as much impermanent loss basically so I will keep you guys updated long story short they are about the same actually compared to like what we were at over here but when you look specifically like at worst case scenario we've kind of gone back up from that worst case[4:16]scenario and how bad it was at that one point in time so to demonstrate that as you can see these positions were I mean at one point worth like fifty seven they went down all the way to like forty five point five now we're back up to like forty seven point five over here basically so we're up like two[4:32]K from that from that um you know very very bottom price I should say you know we're definitely not back up to fifty seven K hopefully that'll come soon once again holding these positions out these are not doing crazy returns mainly because they haven't been in range so this return that we're factored[4:46]in right here is you know low You know some of them haven't been in range and they've only been open for like a week or so uh but still not not too disappointed not to uh happy either I guess I'm kind of like in the middle there holding them out that's the strategy that I'm running with I did however[5:01]at one point in time open up a mad at USDC position um as you can see it did 550% APR this was the trade that I could have done a little bit better uh but it still did pretty good I would say basically to play like 2,500 bucks um I since you my overall goal here was like hey I got 2,500 bucks if Matt[5:18]goes up I want to basically Thank you. Uh, sell it if Matt goes down I want to buy Matt. You know because Matt was at like 62 since when I opened up that position so I opened up like 50-50. [5:28]Uh I could have probably waited it more bullish where I had like 70% Matt I could have made a little bit more money than but oh well.
