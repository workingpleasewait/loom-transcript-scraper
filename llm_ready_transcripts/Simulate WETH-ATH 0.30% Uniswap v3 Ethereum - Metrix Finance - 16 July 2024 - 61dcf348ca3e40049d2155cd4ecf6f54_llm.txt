[00:00]Okay, let me make my face cam small. Um, so yeah, I mean let's take a look at this theorem to ATH. [00:07]Just a follow up video. If you haven't already watched it, I just posted a finding solid d5 positions right now. [00:12]This is the first, or this is the second half of that kind of video where I'm essentially going and finding the ranges basically now. [00:17]Um, we're starting with eth ATH. volumes down over the past 30 days. It's the first thing I look at. Um, still looks like it's a solid return. [00:26]This one is on the Ethereum network. It is a negative correlation over the past 30 days, so let's keep that in mind. [00:32]Um, and let's start to find our range. So So if we wanted to do range, probably gonna do like 56,000. [00:40]And on the top, um, I'm gonna keep it around plus 25, minus 25. Um, but I wanna give it some more downside, because it looks like over here, this is a whole trend where ATH does really good, and then more recently over the past couple days, ETH has done a little bit better, but that's fine after seeing[00:55]it run like that. We'll grab about 60% ATH right here if we have time. 35,000 and 56,000. Um, closer we can get this like price to the geometric mean the better, or closer we can have like 50-50 of each asset the better I guess you could say. [01:11]Um, but yeah, and then as far as like capital goes, I was thinking like around 6,000 in here. Let's drag this down to a 15-day or 14-day calculation range. [01:25]We'll do 14 days. Um, that's estimated about 17 bucks per day. We'll do 1 day, that's 11 bucks per day on a bad day. [01:33]2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 8 days, 9 days, 10 days, 11 days. Okay, we're going to do 15 days basically. [01:43]That's about 100%, which would be pretty good I would say, and that's pretty consistent. You know, we see big jumps on specific days, goes back down to average. [01:51]Worst case, we're doing 11 bucks per day. Now here's the thing though, to actually get into a position, we want to see how much that is. [01:59]So, we can do Ethan. If we scroll down to cost of transaction actions, and just search for Uniswap, it's showing like 5 dollars and 20 cents, so that's not bad in my opinion. [02:13]Question is, does it actually cost that? So, if I were to go over to Aperture, and keep in mind Aperture, I'd probably do a zap in, so it's probably going to use more gas. [02:20]Do keep that in mind, uhm, I just want to like kind of test it, test the waters, cause if it is 5 bucks, like I'm happy, like take my 5 dollars, uhm, if we were to do E-A-T-H, we gotta go grab, ETH token, contract address. [02:40]So we can do that, oh, A-T-H is also an arbitrum, we could check that out, by the way, uhm, DEX screener, pull that up, just have it there, zap in, we would want to do 0.3% ETH, let's just say we're gonna put 0.05 ETH in, you know, it's gonna have to zap either way, and None. [03:01]Our range, sometimes gas will be different depending on our range, 35,000 to 56,000, so we want to do 35,000, 56,000, just to give us an idea, let's see how much slippage we're gonna have and then we can actually backtest gas, man this is taking a while. [03:20]Okay, so it looks like there's a 0.3% price impact, that's fine, uhm we were to open up this position right now, we're gonna pay, drumroll please, $10 in gas, so I mean it's more cause we're doing that zap bid, but that's not bad, I would be fine paying $10 in gas to get into this position, uhm, 8 ether[03:39], it's done pretty well. Well, for the past 3 months, 1 month, if we were to do, let's just say, yeah cause 3 months it's only been around since like June 12th, it's only been around for a month, so keep that in mind, uhm, if we were to cut out those days, it's still done pretty fairly well in my opinion[03:57], uhm, but, again, I don't know, is this something that I want to allocate a large amount of capital to? I don't know. [04:03]It's $280 million in market cap, I'm gonna take a look over at markets and kinda see where volume is, there's a lot of volume over on OKX, uhm, centralized exchanges, we could take a look over at, uhm, volume history over here. [04:20]I'm gonna come in, doing 500k to a mil a day consistently, and some days we have like big 2 mil days, hmmm. [04:29]Okay, this is a consideration, alright, so what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna save it to portfolio, just so I have it favorited, and then, go take a look at my breadth. [04:40]ETH position, because this is one that I know I want to get in, if I get in about 2500 bucks, uhm, slippage on breadth, that's something I want to check, right? [04:49]So if I wanted to go and swap breadth right now for Ethereum, let's see how much slippage we get. Breadth for eth, let's say we have 0.6. [05:02]0.75, right? Uhm, so let's say there's 18,000 breadth that we have to swap. Uhm, we are incurring roughly 35, 40 dollars in slippage basically.
