[00:00]Now we are going to be diving into some simulations, so this one might be a little bit longer, might be the same length as the last one, I don't know. [00:09]Uh, let's dive in. We're gonna start with Ethereum to Syrup. This one right over here is one of the ones that we favorited, right? [00:15]Syrup looked pretty solid. Assuming we've done the due diligence on the assets, which we've done some high-level stuff, obviously, before, like, deploying large chunks of capital, and we're definitely gonna be gonna do more due diligence, but just wanted to go ahead and check things out. [00:27]So, Syrup, right? Million and a half in TVL. Say I wanted to go in with, like, 15 grand on this one, you know, I could scale up pretty easily. [00:35]Uh, I'm not gonna, you know, tarnish my yield too much. Uhm, the other thing I will say is there's a lot of broad-range liquidity here. [00:41]Yes, there's some ramp-up right here, but it's not that much compared to a lot of different pools. Uhm, I guess that's also partially because it's on the 1% fee tier. Uh, but with that being said, let's look at this calculation range and pool price. [00:53]We have a negative 38% correlation over the past 30 days. Seems scary, but this is where you have to start to adjust different parameters. [01:00]14 days, it's now 0.17%. 7 days, it's negative 0.1%. Uh, if we do, like, 10 days, like, 0.06%. So, again, this thing adjusts like hotcakes, like, literally over the counter. [01:12]Of course, of, of a couple days. Uhm, so we're definitely gonna have to do a broader range in this. So, I, if I'm diving into this, I'm doing $22,000 on the top, and I'm probably gonna do, let's see, something like that gets me 50-50. If I wanted more syrup, I could go 9,000. Still doing 230% APR. [01:33]Very good. Uhm, volume, though, yeah. Inconsistent. So, again, this one isn't looking too appealing to me. Uh, because volume's, like, dropping off a cliff. [01:41]Uh, that's still 184, or, sorry, 150% right there, which isn't bad. Okay, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna save this one. [01:48]Use a four-day calculation range. Uhm, one of my thoughts is, like, can we hedge syrup, right? Uh, because if we can hedge syrup, then, what do you know? [01:59]Uhm, that might be a get a good option for a delta neutral position. So, syrup. I don't see it there. [02:07]And I'll go over here, syrup. And, we'll check it out on coin get go, basically. So, I have it on mech-c, which is good. [02:18]Umm, okay. Being- Thank watching. Yeah, they have it on some DEXs. Like some normal DEXs, but nothing that I can find for like, a place where we could short it on a perpetual exchange or something. [02:37]So, really, we're gonna have to do some centralization here. But, that's completely fine. A little bit of centralization never hurt, nobody. [02:43]Just kidding. But, uh, I would be fine using a synchos exchange to short this in all honesty. Umm, a lot of times you have a little bit more control over leverage there, and it's a little less clunky. [02:53]Uh, so that's definitely an option. We're gonna save it to the portfolio. If we didn't already, we might have, I'll have to check that out. [02:59]Okay, so we got it in here. And then the next one that I'm gonna dive into is going to be, say, Ando to the Ethereum. [03:07]You never go wrong with the Ando Ethereum. If I'm diving into Ando Ethereum, I'm not gonna be hedging this. This is gonna be one that I'm gonna take. [03:12]Pull it. Exposure to just because I am pretty bullish and Ando. Say we did 15 grand in this guy. And we're gonna look. [03:20]We've got correlation. This correlation is very, very good. I'm gonna make my face smaller because it's taking up a lot of the screen. [03:25]We're gonna put it right up here. But yeah, this correlation is great, right? So if I'm diving into this one, going with the tighter range, we're gonna do something like 2700. And then over here, we're gonna do like 1900, maybe 1950. Get us a little less Ando. [03:42]That right, there's amazing. Umm, if we tone it down on the calculation range, we're still getting 80%, which is still very good. [03:49]Umm, and if we put our calculation price over here, we're still getting 50% on Ando on a worst case scenario. That's good, right?
