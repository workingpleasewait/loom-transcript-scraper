[0:01]Hey guys, just wanted to go ahead and let you know that I'm putting out my brand new spreadsheet So I used to have one that was like public to everybody that watches my youtube channel would not in our free discord server now This spreadsheets private Essentially only you guys can access it. [0:14]I just don't be sharing the link to people outside The group obviously and additionally my wallet address is still public to anybody but they're not gonna get this spreadsheet So this is gonna track like all my impermanent loss from my pools So is my earnings my price my profit loss total, you know, [0:28]all this stuff I and I will say don't go blindly copy in my positions. Make sure you do your own due diligence and feel free and Happy for me. [1:05]As well as it's doing a 58% APR and I've only been in it for about four days. So that's not too bad. [1:10]That's a 7% return on my investment right there in the time span of four days, mainly due to price appreciation. [1:15]Go ahead and further render your soul. This has 25 bucks and a permanent loss, but it has done, done done. [1:21]116 bucks of earnings and I only have 7.7 K allocated to it. So that is also one of my better performing positions. [1:27]It's doing a 170% APR. Then of course, LUSD is sitting out of range right now, but it's doing 20%. I might be getting out of this pool relatively soon. [1:35]Just gonna wait for the right time for Ethereum gas fees. To be well now there is something that I do want to go and mention. [1:39]My goal is to find that balance between number one short term speculation, which is earning earnings and earning fees, but also number two long term speculation, which is long term price appreciation. [1:51]So you'll notice some of these positions. Have a lot of impermanent loss, others the impermanent losses manage. The ones like wrap Bitcoin to matic. [1:58]I don't really worry too much about because well, I wouldn't go and put, you know, 15 $16,000 just into rapid Quinn and Justin to matic right. [2:07]I wouldn't plan on holding this. I would plan on being in. A pool for this so to an extent I'm in the pool because obviously I want to make the money but also at the same time I'm making sure I'm doing it with assets that I would plan on holding so impermanent loss isn't the best metric but I do try[2:20]to outperform it most case scenarios so you will see there are occasionally times where I don't outperform impermanent loss and a lot of those times are actually with USDC paired pools like for example if we go and we look at this pool right here has 117 bucks in impermanent loss but $25 of earnings[2:34]that got completely wrecked we go down the list a little bit though you'll notice that there are some that have like say 644 bucks of earnings and this has $193 of impermanent loss that's not bad there's other ones that have a lot better results as well so that's just another thing i wanted to go and[2:49]mention my goal isn't necessarily to outperform impermanent loss a hundred percent of the time but i will try to outperform a permanent loss like you know 80 80 percent or so of the time and it does depend on the strategy like omdusdc for example this one has like three dollars of impermanent gain i'm[3:04]not sure how that's being calculated but it has 117 dollars in fees if i was in omdusdc and i did have more impermanent loss in fees my goal wouldn't be to have you know money made from om appreciation my goal would be to make a stable income as long as i'm making that stable income i'm happy basically[3:20]so that's just one thing little word of advice i want to give out let me know if you guys have any questions about this spreadsheet feel free to duplicate it feel free to do what you wish to do with it there's all types of positions in here there is jones dow which leverage glp position there's tinder[3:33]finance setify there's trader joe uni swap quick swap aerodrome yield flow gamma there's so many different positions in here feel free to ask me what went wrong what happened in any positions happy to answer this question questions that i look forward to hearing from you guys peace
