[0:00]Okay, so to provide, like, single-sided liquidity on a platform like Uniswap, it's actually pretty simple. You just need, like, one of the assets. [0:09]Now, what I'm going to dive into is the actual strategy. So, right now, I have a couple assets in my wallet that I'm just hodling. [0:16]Uhm, let's take a look at these. I have primarily, let's just say we have FET. FET's the asset that we want to exit with, right? [0:25]Uhm, this works best when you're doing stuff, like, with a stablecoin. So if I were to do FET, to USDC over here, right? [0:34]Just like that, I would choose the fee tier. Primarily, the one that's going to have, uhm, what do you call it? [0:39]The highest, uh, highest fee earning potential, basically. Uhm, and then, as far as my price goes, right? Right now, FET is at, I believe, like, a dollar around that. [0:49]Uhm, let's take a look over here. Yeah, $1.04, right? So, say I want to exit at, like, $1.05. What I could do is, if I just want to simply have a sell order, I do a dollar point five one to a dollar point five four, right? [1:02]Just a one tick range, basically. This is one tick right here. Uhm, and then I would put up the FET, just like that. [1:07]I only need to put up FET, and then when it gets to, uhm, this price, it'll sell me out of the position. [1:12]But the thing is, after it crosses over $1.54, we need to close out the position. Otherwise, it will, uhm, what do you call it? [1:20]It'll just, if the price goes back down, it'll convert me back into, to, to FET, as opposed to converting me into USDC. [1:26]Because when it goes from $1.51 to $1.54, I will be in full USDC after $1.54. Whereas if it goes back, then I get converted back into FET. [1:33]Now, during this time, I will actually collect fees, because people are paying fees to trade, which is why the price of this pool is going up. [1:40]Uhm, so yeah, that's how you do it. And you just do it the vice versa, if you want to, like, sell, like, or buy, or something like that. [1:45]So right now, if I have full USDC, and I want to buy at a price of, uh, .9 to, let's just say, like, a little bit above that, right? [1:55]So around this range, and I would just put up full USDC, and then I would close when I go below this price. [2:00]Uhm, you can. You use tools like Aperture, uh, to kind of automatically close your position. So if we go over to Liquidity Position, we do a new position, basically. [2:09]Uhm, let me switch it over to Uniswap. Uhm, we basically just have a trigger on our position that exits at a specific price, or we can do something over here on, uhm, what do you call it, Aperture for, like, a revenue earning limit order, this works too. [2:25]I mean, the same thing, they accomplish the same thing. This will just exit after the specific price. Another cool thing that you could do is you could, like, dollar cost average, so if we wanted to do 0.8 to 0.9, it'll probably average out to around 0.85 buy-in price, uhm, but yeah, you just close out[2:39]once you get below that range, uhm, and then the other thing is if you want to shift into another asset, so if we were doing FET to Ethereum, right, uhm, and let's just say the current price of FET to Ethereum is, one sec, so if I pull up FET to Ethereum over on Metrics, this will give me, like, a greater[2:57]idea, uhm, because essentially what we want to do is whenever FET outperforms Ethereum, well, it's going to sell us out of FET and it'll sell us into Ethereum, or vice versa, whenever, uhm, FET underperforms Ethereum, we buy into FET using the Ethereum, so if we were to do the 0.3% tier over here on[3:13]this, uh, FET to Ethereum, and we were to look at it this way, uhm, with the current price being 2160, right, so if we were to do, uhm, something like 1900, just like that, uhm, then, let's see what that looks like over here. [3:32]Our low price, high price, one tick range, right, or we could spread it out, but basically, whenever, uh, FET does pretty well, right, the price of this is going to go down, uhm, and then, when it gets to this price over here, when FET outperforms Ethereum, it's going to convert us fully into Ethereum[3:48], and then we can close out the position, uh, or we could do the vice versa, so, pretty simple concept, you're just putting one asset up, and, uh, yeah.
