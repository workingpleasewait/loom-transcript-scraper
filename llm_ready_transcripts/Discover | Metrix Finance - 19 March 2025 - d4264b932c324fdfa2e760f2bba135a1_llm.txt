[00:00]So I want to get in the habit of doing a couple more of these, just like on a weekly basis, where we browse through metrics, find some opportunities, and see what looks good, basically. [00:08]So, I'm going to pull up metrics on Discover, we're going to start with the Ethereum network, uhm, just because Ethereum has always been where, where the consistent yields are. [00:17]So I'm like, really loving Ethereum. Also, I was speaking to a hedge fund manager the other day, and they say the same thing, it's like, yeah, we never went to Solana. [00:24]We never went to any of these things, and in the short term, it looks bad, you know, when Solana goes from, uh, $100 to $250, right, it looks like we missed out on something large, but now it's instantly retraced back down to, you know, $125, $110, you know, uhm, so ultimately, like, they're holding[00:43]for the very, very long term, so when they dive into liquidity pools, they've always been looking at Ethereum. Uhm, I'm looking for correlated pairs, so let's just say Ethereum is included here, uhm, and then over here we're going to start to filter down, so APRs, I want to do higher than 40%, uhm, we're[00:58]going to do lower than 500%, we got 269 pools still, I'm going to adjust this calculation range just to look at some of the more recent data, uh, that's what I have noticed, the more recent data, we're going to use 7 days actually, uhm, it's a little bit better, like, uh, it's, you know, it's like a[01:13]declining chart, so we only want to look at recent data basically, TVL, we're going to do higher than a million bucks, especially since we're on the Ethereum network, uh, we're going to cut this list in half, uhm, and then we're only going to have 50 to browse through, so I'm going to look through highest[01:27]to lowest, and I'm just going to grab 20 per page basically, and then go to page 3, and considering that there is 119 here, We're just going to cut that this thing in half, so we're going to use, let's just say 0.03 as our min on this, higher than 0.03, just like that, we have 53 pools, so let's start[01:49]to look through them, let's see what, uh, opportunities we have available basically, uh, Syrup, this is something that I've been kind of eyeing over the past couple months, and by the way, the market's going and crazy. [02:00]Today, it's nice to see, cross our fingers, right, uhm, we have the foam C meeting today in the United States, so Syrup, okay, over the past year, pretty harsh, but over the past three months, a little bit better, right, uh, over the past one month, also pretty solid, one month's up 2.7%, 14 days, 2.5%, [02:20]so 100 million dollar market cap assets, so a little a bit riskier. Infinite supply, so I'd be eager to see kind of their supply mechanism and how that actually works. [02:29]Uh, we could dive into this, secured lending, redefined, Syrup Finance, institutional yield unlocked. So, I think we talked about this a little bit ago, but basically, uhm, Maple Finance is like, uh, kind of TradFi stuff, basically, uhm, or like centralized, whereas Syrup Finance is the decentralized[02:46]aspect of that, basically. I think, uh, the concept is, by lending out over on Syrup Finance, you can, you know, people on Maple can then go and borrow, I believe, uhm, but I'm not entirely sure. [03:00]I have to dig a little bit deeper into how this works, uhm, but yeah, I just remember some, some interesting model like that. [03:08]Now, what I'm curious for is, obviously, uh, the inflationary aspect of Syrup, so we're gonna dive into that. Uh, introducing Syrup. [03:17]Okay. Syrup tokenomics is what we're looking for. Previously, recapitalized Maple Treasury. Mint issuance does not represent an increase, but a conversion of 1 to 100. Syrup would need no dilution. [03:40]So, like, off the bat, it seemed, seems like there's no, not really much inflation, but it shows infinite in the contract, which is interesting. [03:50]Uhm, what we can always do is test that, right? What's the maximum? Sometimes they give out the API feed, which in this case scenario. [03:58]It doesn't look like they are. Yeah, I don't, I don't know, so I'll have to look more into that. But, most definitely, like, an intriguing pool if, if this is a solid asset, you know. [04:08]Uhm, cause it does have, like, the platforms have a use case. We'd obviously want to backtest to make sure the, uhm, actual tokens can play into their platform. [04:17]So that's one. Uhm, we have usual. Now, in my opinion, usual is probably a little bit too volatile for me. [04:24]But, we're gonna do a dive into it regardless. One month is down 31%. It's not bad, Ethereum's down that. But, three months, we're from a $1.50 to $0.15, down 90%. Uhm, so I'd say I still want that thing to cool off. [04:39]Uhm, you know, again, they got a cool, cool protocol, uhm, but the token has to, to play in the ecosystem well. [04:49]So, we also got Move. I've been seeing a lot about Move recently. Uncoin Gecko, it's always trending and stuff like that.
