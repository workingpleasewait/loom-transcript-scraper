[00:01]I feel like I have been recording for like half of the day basically. I've recorded a lot of course lessons and everything for this new kind of rebrand that we're doing um You guys are gonna love that stuff I'm gonna put that out there But also I recorded like a video for metrics video for my main YouTube[00:16]channel and I did like an hour of content earlier like internally and you guys are about to get some more stuff so exciting stuff I enjoy this stuff by the way um but yeah it's about midnight we're gonna go through we're gonna find a new position uh to replace the um the OVN one that I just exited I[00:33]kind of called it quits on that um so yeah we're gonna go ahead and find something new find something better uh I'm just gonna clear up my favorite and keep in mind what I'm running with the portfolio right now is basically these two positions the ETH spec as well as the ETH link so those are the two[00:49]that I'm running let me delete that and that's doing roughly or estimated to do about a 70% APR I want to throw something in here that's like higher risk right because this is gonna be a total of $42,000 of capital and then according to the bank I got 7700 over here and I also got like 900 bucks of ETH[01:09]or 950 of ETH to deploy that was like uhm from the old ETH prep position that I was in and then I also want to create a hedge position or hedged out in permanent loss where I'm actually borrowing against it uh because as you can see I got this ETH borrow over here which is like 3225 um so yeah I got[01:27]another like you know at that point like 1012 or so to deploy uh which would really bolster that return depending on what we can do so yeah let's dive in we're gonna start on the discovery page I'm gonna look across Uniswap um pancake swap this was orca radium and those are kind of the ones I want to[01:47]stick on do ethereum arbitrum optimism polygon base bnb chain solana we'll go with these ones um fees apr I always do lower than a thousand percent to cut off like the crazy stuff do higher than let's say 40 percent or 50 percent um 682 pools tvi do above a million bucks um yeah that's right get 260[02:13]pools and over here price volatility we are going to do that's right over here um do great greater than 5 percent and where it says feed to tvl ratio we're going to do greater than.05 percent let's try that this is 92 different pools okay we are solid not sure Boy, these are checked. [02:37]Let's uncheck these ones. Let's dive in. So first thing is Brett and this was already like on my on my hit list we have Ondo as well. [02:45]I'm going to go check out price of both of these Brett as well as Ondo Brett is up 20 percent today. [02:53]That's good. Don't know if I want to deploy when it's up 20 percent maybe an out of range position that's an idea. [02:59]Uhm. Uhm. Ondo, this is up obviously today everything is up today so that's a given, 3 months, okay. It's not bad. [03:08]It's down 7.8 percent, down 7.7 percent. I'm rocking with that. And Ondo finances obviously real world assets and everything. Actually I'm trying to line up an AMA with somebody that used to work for Ondo now works for Minecraft. [03:22]Midas I think it is, yeah Midas, they work for Midas now. So yeah that would be pretty cool to line them up because they'd be able to comment on both of them. [03:29]I'd probably say that Midas is better in all honesty but it is what it is. Yeah so that's that, these we can both bookmark because these look solid at least in terms of assets. [03:38]I have no clue what Mog is but that's in 4. So maybe we want to do like a little test over there. [03:48]Well 783, it's on Ethereum Network and Base Network, this is over on the Ethereum Network. About Mog, fun meme, launched at a fair amount meme coin, project truly some special, okay, yeah it's a meme at the end of the day, there's nothing more to it, it's literally a meme. [04:12]It's a meme with 785 million dollar market cap, it could be a cool experiment, actually let's see. First asset must include Bitcoin. [04:22]Okay, so there's only the one on the Ethereum network, see if I'm running a meme coin I don't want to be on the Ethereum network, that's the thing, cause I don't want to deal with all the, okay we'll bookmark it. [04:31]Actually no, because if I'm deploying even a couple thousand it's not worth it, even if I am doing 400% APR. [04:37]Pindle, this would be a good one, let's check out the price of Pindle. I also want to look at Tan, 3 months, oof, Pindle, man, what happened, 13.6%, oh so this isn't even that bad, this is like $5.90, this is like $4.55, so let's see, top to bottom bottom, oh that is higher than 50%, so that is pretty[05:04]bad, if we do from like literally the $7 mark to the $3.30 mark that's like 50%, uhm, so yeah we'd have to have a bullish outlook on Pindle, nothing I'm too crazy about, uhm it really depends what Pindle is Pindle TVL is doing, let's take a look at that, Pindle TVL, which Pindle TVL has, whew, gone down[05:29]significantly, the reason why, airdrop farming, so let's avoid it for now, uhm, Y token, this is like my process guys, this is like literally just going through this, now keep in mind a lot of times I could see what's what based on logos, I know it sounds stupid but like, I could see why is like a meme[05:49]coin off the bat, cause it's got like one of these silly looking logos, Mog, silly looking logo, Brett has a friggin frog in it, you know, so we can see what's a meme and what's not, uhm, so yeah.
