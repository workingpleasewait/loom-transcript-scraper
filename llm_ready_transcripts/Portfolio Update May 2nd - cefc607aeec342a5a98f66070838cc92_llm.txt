[0:00]Alright, so the market is getting completely killed, so I'm going to do a portfolio overview. It's 1am, uh, but I'm also gonna go ahead and do a market overview tomorrow. [0:09]I just, I've been moving back to my hometown, as you can see, new setup, pretty great, uhm, excited to be here. [0:16]But, that's why I've been a little bit busy, excited to get back in the groove. We've also been scaling up, so some cool things there, uhm, but yeah, I just want to go over my portfolio. [0:24]Deployed 54.5, worth 48.5, uhm, so down about $6,000 right there. But that's just from principal assets, do keep that in mind. [0:32]We've got about $1252 of impermanent loss, about $2200 of earnings outweighing that impermanent loss, that's great, that's amazing. Uhm, take a look at ETH Render, we'll dive into this first. [0:42]Deployed 10 here, currently 8.2, is what it is at the end of the day. We do have $118 of permanent loss, we have negative $1800 of price, but we have $625 of earnings, so this one's doing it's job, this one's working really well. [0:56]Earnings outweighing permanent loss by a long shot, we're at a profit against market, which is great, but still down $1200. [1:02]Not too worried about that one. Doing about 85% APR, but realistically it's doing about like 40% APR when you factor in the past like 7 days, because volume has been down for that pool. [1:13]Been deployed into this one for nearly 30 days. Very happy though. Uhm, BNB FET, this one deployed 9.9, currently we're at 7.7, so down $2,200 from price. [1:23]At about $400 of impermanent loss, but also $400 of earnings. Breaking even right there, not a big deal in this one. [1:29]Once again, been deployed for nearly a month basically. Uhm, so down total of $1,800. It's doing decent, it's not as good as Render. [1:36]It is what it is at the end of the day. I do like Fett and I think once this market comes back and we start to see that bull run again, it's going to do pretty well. [1:44]I will say this one is literally on the fence of going out of range, so I do need to be careful with this. [1:50]like 1% BNB right now, so BNB has been doing better than Fett. It's about 55% APR. I might rebalance it to a tighter range, but also I'm not like rushing the rebalance because I do think it's going to get kicked back in range and I could get it out at a better price. [2:04]Worst case, I get like 30-40 bucks from impermanent loss, oh well. Or extra impermanent loss compared to what I currently have I should say. [2:10]This base maxi, this one was absolutely killing it. Now it is doing good, just not as not nearly as good. [2:18]So I deployed roughly 31-60, it's currently worth 28-37. There's about 531 dollars in impermanent loss. One thing I'm going to go ahead and mention, shout out to Thomas in this group, he's the one that created this vault. [2:30]It's been killing it right? And it's doing it's job. It's essentially backed by Aero USDC I believe, ETH Wells, and there's also like an OVN pool on there. [2:40]All those pools are on Aerodrome, doing about 386% APR, realistically more recently still about 300%. So I'm happy with that. [2:48]Comparing my entire portfolio, which is great, but basically my permanent loss, instead of comparing it to those pools because there's constant adjustments, I'm just comparing it to if I held ETH, because that's the initial asset that I started with. [2:59]I initially deployed one ETH into this pool basically. I'm down $630 from price, but I have $620 in overall. So beating the permanent loss by nearly $100, but still at the same exact time, I'm nearly breaking even with price. [3:12]So this one, doing it's job, been deployed for 20 days. ETH world coin, 7.5k deposit, currently worth $6.8k. I've been getting killed on world coin. [3:20]If we go ahead and look at another one of these world coin pools, you can see I started with 10.6, went down to 9.4, compounded, so 9.6 to 9, and then compounded again, 9.2 to 7.4, and then from here we're at like 7.5k. [3:36]I had to 6.8, so world coin, it's been killing me, but I'm in it for the long haul guys, and I don't want to lock in a total loss on world coin, so I've just been kind of wading it out. [3:45]Umm, and I do think it's a solid asset, but normally if I was like, add a little bit of a profit or a break even, or even a tiny bit of a loss, I would. [3:52]I would've just like, scratched world coin out the list. Since I'm at such great of a loss, my strategy is honestly to just hold this out.
