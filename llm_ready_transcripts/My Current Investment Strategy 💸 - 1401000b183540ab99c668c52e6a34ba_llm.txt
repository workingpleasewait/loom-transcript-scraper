[0:01]Okay, so I want to go ahead and show you guys exactly what I'm deployed into. By the way, capital is down. [0:06]This is great. Market's tankin'. I'm excited. I already got the stable coins borrowed. I'm waiting for Bitcoin to go down towards the 50 mark, and that's where I'm starting my entry. [0:14]If I sense that we are starting to recover, then I am going to start to buy up some Bitcoin. Uhm, anyways, I deployed 5k the other day, uh, when Sol was at, like, 130, 135. [0:28]Uhm, hindsight probably should've waited, but I'm like, oh yeah, you know. Like, right over here is where we are at. [0:34]Like, this little area right here. And, you know, it dumped a little bit more since then, but oh well. Uhm, not a big deal. [0:39]Uhm, so yeah, what I was going to show you is just what I'm currently invested into. When I deployed into Sol, I deployed into Sol2USDC. [0:46]That is right here. I have $26 in APR so far. Uhm, I think I'm almost out of range, which is good, because that means that I'm going to get converted into full Sol, and I can kind of, uh, what do you call it? [1:00]Uhm, start to, like, sell as we, as we go back up, and, and just kind of hodl some of it. [1:05]But, uhm, yeah, I'm not entirely sure what the process is. I'll probably get converted into full Sol, and then I'll take another, like, 2 grand or so of, uhm, USDC, and then I'll pair it with, uhm, the Sol to just, like, get back into the market, but not have to sell any of that Sol, and then sell as[1:20]the price goes up. Uhm, that's one of the things I can do. But, uhm, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of different things I could do. [1:26]So, that's doing about 180% APR, pretty happy with that. Uhm, I think it's more like 150%, but, uh, I'll show you what my portfolio's looking like over here. [1:38]It's been a minute since I used Orca, but, yeah, I mean, as you can see, about 0.5%. My deployment was about 2 days ago, uhm, so I guess if we do 26 divided by 2, and then times 365, yeah, that's about 100% APR, actually. [1:55]That's literally, like, what I deployed. Um, so that's not bad whatsoever. And then I have to. After that, that was just a new capital play with, like, 5K. [2:05]Uhm, I also went and borrowed about $14,000 against my, uhm, you know, wrapped Staked Ethereum, uh, wrapped Bitcoin and LINK. [2:16]Now, here's the play that I'm doing right now, because I have this LINK to USDC pool. It's an out-of-range LP, supposed to sell at 14 to 16. [2:23]Right now, LINK's at $9.50, right? So I could take this $23,000 right here, put it up as collateral. Go over on AUB as well, and then borrow another $10K on top of that in USDC. [2:36]Uhm, and I haven't even borrowed against my MATIC. I haven't borrowed against my SOL positions yet either. Uhm, so that's all stuff that I can do. [2:42]Take that, and then just throw it into, you know, concentrated liquidity pools for, uh, stablecoins. So I have this Trader Joe one, which is doing about a 25 to 30% APR. [2:51]Uhm, I will say there's only $150K of capital in here. But the thing is, I know if I have USD+, I'll be completely fine. [2:59]I believe in USD+, so worst case scenario, I'll I'm in USD+, and I could sell it directly back to the Treasury. [3:05]Uhm, but yeah, this one's doing pretty solid. Let me find my pools. Uhm, it's getting ARB incentives. I just have, like, one single range. [3:12]One thing I have noticed is this rewarded range bounces around, like, all the time. So, if I want to, uhm, get to that rewarded range, I'm gonna have to constantly, like, adjust this pool. [3:21]But, $120K in liquidity, uhm, and what I kind of did, just looked at the bins traded over the past 30 days. [3:28]Which, by the way, let me know if you guys want to see something like this on metric. But, for just, like, other concentrated liquidity pools, where we can show which prices are most often traded, cause that would allow us to, like, better structure a range. [3:38]Uhm, and then over here, it looks like, uh, it's actually all on this price. So, I'm gonna move my liquidity over here, basically. [3:46]Uhm, but yeah, this is kind of, like, a little bit of an active position. Super easy to move. Just, like, do remove, and then add.
