[0:01]So, when it comes to my hedge over here, this kind of hedge that I'm trying out in Ethereum to USDC position using gamma basically, here's the thing. [0:11]There's not enough volatility to actually kind of outweigh my impermanent loss. Right now I'm just raking up that uh, what do you call it? [0:19]That uh, borrow fee that I'm having. Having to pay which is that negative 17 dollars right there. So, if we look over here, negative 17 dollars puts me at like 93 bucks basically. [0:28]Uhm, and then over here I have, and this includes that 93 bucks, keep in mind, 32.14, uhm, my deposit was 32.98 basically. [0:39]So, it's kind of a tricky situation. You know, I have 30 bucks of impermanent loss, but I'm not being able to hedge out that impermanent loss simply due to the fact that there's too much, or the market's too steady. [0:52]If there's more volatility in the market, if the market was swinging down 10, 20, 30 percent, like, uhm, or even up, you know, I'm hedging out all of that impermanent loss, basically. [1:02]But in this scenario, that's not working. But I do have $61 in earnings, which helps out a ton, but keep in mind that's an escrowed Arbitrum token, so then I need to go and create a hedge on that escrowed Arbitrum token, so that way I don't have to worry about the Arbitrum token fluctuating in price. [1:17]So just a couple things that I noticed when running this Ethereum GSDC hedge position. Remember, I am borrowing against uhm my, what do you call it, my Ethereum. [1:26]I'm borrowing Ethereum against my Ethereum. And I guess a good judge of this is my borrow, right, because this is the amount that I basically put in the position. [1:33]I have $3151 over here, uhm, and then over here I have $3214, so actually, in theory, I have made a profit. [1:42]Uhm, but I'm not sure if this uhm, over here is liquid, this uh, section where I'm executing this thing, like if I close, it actually looks like I am going to get, uh, some Ethereum back. [1:57]So, yeah, pretty interesting concept, I don't know, uhm. We'll kind of see how this goes, I'll keep you guys posted on how this goes, uhm, but, I'm eager to see.
