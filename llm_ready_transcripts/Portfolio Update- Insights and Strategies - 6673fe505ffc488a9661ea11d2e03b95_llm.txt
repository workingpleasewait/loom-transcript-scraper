[0:00]Hey everybody, sorry for the horrendous lighting. I am currently in the middle of a move, so I'm back at my ordinary house, moving out to the apartment, uhm, a little bit of back and forth right now. [0:11]But I did want to provide a portfolio update, just kind of show you what I'm working with right now. So I currently have about- $46,500 deployed of these positions Im currently down $70. [0:21]Now something that I really want to stress is I would be down $1,700 or maybe about $1,400 but since Im in these pools Im only down $70 because I have these earnings and thats the important part. [0:32]Of time in the market as opposed to timing the market right I could of you know waited till now to enter into these pools but if I waited till now to enter into these pools on the dip number one I could of missed the dip but number two I also wouldnt of had the 1700 dollars in earnings that I have by[0:49]being in these pools for a countless amount of days like 16 days or 23 days or something like that right uhm but going a little bit further still running this Archimedes finance strategy its about 14 buck or sorry 14 percent on ethereum and I have about one ethereum in there so relatively happy with[1:03]that I'm about 560 from price made about 56 bucks in earnings overall profit of 610 not too bad been in this for literally 3 months now I probably am going to exit soon mainly because I do want to allocate that capital to some other positions but looking over here at rapid coin matic as you can see I[1:20]deployed roughly 14952 currently at 14243 so I am down 710 dollars to price action I have about 90 bucks worth of impermanent loss which means if I just held my money in rapid coin matic I held my initial allocation I would have only been down roughly 620 bucks right but I do have 800 dollars in earnings[1:40]by being in this pool which is ultimately outweighing that downside putting me at a 90 dollar overall profit so very happy with that these three stable coin positions now I am satisfied with the aerodrome position I am satisfied with the trader joe position I am no longer satisfied with the orca position[1:55]and orca was kind of like a huge wave of very nice volumes starting to die off now but there's still some really good positions over there especially if you're doing sole usdc so this is doing about 13% I probably am going to take this capital and go and actually put actually deploy it across this trader[2:10]joe position and this aerodrome position unless I can find a better pool that I can allocate to and get like a 20-25% return remember this capital right here in these 3 stable coin positions this is borrowed capital so I am borrowing against my blue chip assets here right looking over here at orca I[2:26]have rendered sole position this is doing 130% thing is this was initially doing 250% there has been more liquidity coming to the market and there has been less volume which ultimately means lower lower lower return so this is right now on average doing about 75% to 80 percent annually and that's using[2:43]the past 24 hours worth of data now granted that will probably creep back up to 100 but I might explore a different pool just to see if I can get some better returns in a different pool on but as you can see right here I deployed roughly 9130 I currently have 76 55 so you'll notice I have 200 bucks worth[2:59]in permanent loss so if I just held my initial assets I'd be down 1273 since I'm in the pool I'm down 1473 but I do have 530 dollars of earnings so I did outperform in permanent loss this puts me at a negative 950 dollars now something I want to go ahead and mention is render and soul since you just[3:15]retraced because over here we look at this render and soul position I was up 2000 dollars so Im at a net 1000 dollar profit because over here I deployed 7234 I pulled out 9260 but I didnt pull that out I used that capital to rebalance the position and I invested essentially 100 dollars less basically[3:34]I rebalanced the position and my overall goal was to invest like 100 dollars less take like 100 bucks profit so there is that retracement not actually down that amount because the other position balances it out once again 130% APR been in this one for 16 days this is slowly slowly slowly crept down looking[3:50]over here Yielder the platform you can leverage your liquidity pools the only thing I don't like about Yielder and the reason why I haven't deployed any of my own capital into Yielder quite yet is because the market sizes are low and because they havent gotten an audit quite yet I imagine the market[4:03]size is going to grow when they have an audit because I will personally probably deploy some of my own capital and they do have an audit coming this month or I believe next month I'm not too sure but yeah going a little bit further this one I deployed $1500 in its down to $1300 now it is leveraged which[4:18]is why its down 8.73% I have been able to earn roughly 80% on ethereum USDC on the arbitrum network which is not too bad whatsoever and we look over here at you know in permanent loss I have about 100 bucks in permanent loss I have about negative 167 of prize so obviously this one is not doing good this[4:36]is like my worst performing position even though its only down 130 bucks its worst performing because you gotta look at the percentage right and this render to sold doesn't really count simply due to the fact that its balanced out by this other position where I actually made a profit so yeah I just wanted[4:50]to give you guys a portfolio update I hope you guys you know kind of enjoyed this and I hope you guys can kind of learn from this and determine what you want to do once again as always ask me questions down below in the comment section and I'll be happy to answer them have a good one guys peace
