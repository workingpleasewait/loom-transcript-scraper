[00:00]Okay, so I just want to go ahead and provide you guys a quick little portfolio update with what I'm currently invested into I have this Position to OBN to USD plus believe it or not This has been my like best performance position over the past couple weeks Even though blue chips are getting wrecked OBN[00:15]is like standing strong, which I really really like But also there has been periods where OBN crashed down to like 30 Dollars lost like 40% of its value then instantly back up to $50 So it's pretty volatile do keep that in mind probably gonna grab some profit on this soon Just so I can kind of lock in[00:30]a little bit of buffer room there Um, it is risky compound in this position, but at a 12% overall profit doing 200% APR This is really really nice in my opinion been in it for slightly longer Over a month. [00:41]I started with 8.2. I now have 7.8, but I have the 1298 earnings Keep in mind. That's all that compound it back in so pretty solid stuff. [00:51]Um But yeah, next thing I want to go and talk about is going to be the uni swap one This is theory and a link one is a broad range. [00:58]So let me go ahead and pull that Up. It's on the theory and network. So do you keep that in mind basically? [01:04]I'm going to be running a geometrical mean strategy with this when it comes time to rebalance I'll just rebalance and I'll adjust the strategy completely but so far this is doing pretty solid I got a hundred forty bucks in earnings over here. [01:16]Um, I have no impermanent loss. I'm happy with that doing about sixty percent APR. Now, do keep in mind my other ETHlink strategies. [01:25]We want to take a look at those. Um, this one twenty four point seven twenty six. Uh, thirteen bucks in impermanent loss, five ten in earnings. [01:34]So that wasn't bad. Um, this one did have five twenty of impermanent loss, two sixty seven. seven of earnings. So, these outweigh each other. [01:43]Um, this one had a hundred and twenty of impermanent loss, seventy five of earnings. So, the two recent ones didn't do as well. [01:48]The first one is really carrying it right now. Uh, but then the new one that I'm in right now is also pretty, pretty good. [01:53]Um, and it's carrying the overall portfolio. So just a consideration right there. Um, that's two fifty six profit, which is nice. [01:58]Um, and yeah that's that and I'm going to run that geometrical mean strategy when it comes time. Uh, kind of running the geometrical mean strategy with each spec right now. [02:07]I didn't really start with it. Um, but now I'm, I'm testing it. I'm just kind of seeing what, what can be done. [02:13]Um, basically I'm just keeping that geometric mean. Uh, but I'm broadening the range as time goes by, basically, to constantly get bigger and bigger and bigger. [02:22]Uh, and then eventually I just reset the strategy once I feel like, okay, this is time to reset the strategy. [02:26]Uh, and I'll tell you like the indicator that I'm kind of looking at. Uh, this one looks really good, right? [02:30]It shows 557 overall profit. Um, it's doing about 67% APR. Uh, that's because it's a very, very broad range right now. [02:38]Um, and if we take a look over at ETH spec over here, I started with. 12, 13k, uh, went down to 12.1 or 12.2. [02:44]Um, I had 75 bucks in earnings, so I was only down 683. And then I went there, I compounded, that went down to 11.7. [02:51]Uh, so obviously spec was getting killed during this period, down 463. Um, then compounded once again, down 900. Then compounded once again, down 19. [03:02]Now I'm at 9.5. So, you know, I'm up a little bit since then. Um, and that's kind of what I'm hoping for at this point basically. [03:15]Uh, granted I know like six months to a year. We're rock on, you know, we're good. Um, next one, two months, not sure, right?
