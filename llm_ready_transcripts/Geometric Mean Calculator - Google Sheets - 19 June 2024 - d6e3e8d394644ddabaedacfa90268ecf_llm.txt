[0:00]Okay, so we're gonna be talking about how you can practically nearly eliminate impermanent loss using the geometric mean strategy Um, it's gonna be a short tutorial because I'm gonna do a deep dive in this in our liquidity mining masterclass course, basically Um, and keep in mind when I say nearly eliminate[0:16]it I mean nearly eliminate it because it's not gonna be exactly because of the different tick spacings and everything like that, that's what's gonna cause it to be nearly ah, and you know, typically it's gonna depend on the price kind of going back down to your initial entry price Uh, and I'll kind of[0:32]talk about that, right, because we all know like hey, if we open up an Ethereum to USDC liquidity pool or something like that, and the price goes up out of range and then comes back down to our initial entry price, we will have no impermanent loss. [0:45]And right here I'm using a test environment on Metrix Finance just because we are, um, what do you call it, uh, testing this before we throw it on production so you're gonna see these annoying, uh, little notifications over here. [0:58]But, um, I'm gonna pull up Ethereum to USDC liquidity. to kind of demonstrate this scenario, uh, so over here we've added this little geometric mean thing. [1:06]Now your geometric mean is kind of like a center point of your range, is the, somewhat of a way to describe it basically. [1:14]So what I would do here is I would want to get the geometric mean to be a about what the current price is basically. [1:22]So how can I do that, right? Obviously I can adjust this until it goes up to like my current price, which would be $35.64, like kind of like that. [1:32]Um, and as I adjust the range, because it's based on your range, um, it's going to adjust that geometric mean, right? [1:37]If I adjust the current price, it doesn't do anything, but remember. We can't change the price when entering into the liquidity pool, but we can't control the price, sorry. [1:45]Uh, but we can control the geometric mean. Um, so if we adjust the range, we can get the geometric mean, we want to get this to match the current price. [1:53]And once that matches the current price, this is basically kind of like center point for our range. We want to enter as close as possible. [2:00]Uh, where the current price is basically equal to the geometric mean. The closer we can get it, the better. The closer we can time our entry, the better basically. [2:08]Um, and then once we're there, right, say this is about 50% of each asset, so that's one thing you're going to notice, right? [2:14]This is the price point in which you have 50% of each asset. Uh, so if it's a theorem of USDC, let's say the- we're going to- we're going to map all this out. [2:23]This is our range, 28.51 to 44.55. We enter out our geometric mean. Let's say the price goes all the way up. [2:32]Um, USDC stays the same, but Ethereum goes up to 4,000 or something. Um, that would still be in range, basically. [2:40]Uh, maybe we want to say like 4,200. Um, we have 1,089 if we huddle and 1,054 if we are in the LP. [2:50]So I'm going to jot all this down on the spread sheet, start with, and then that's going to be over here. [2:55]We're going to have 500, uh, U-S-D-C-E-C-E and then this will be total DV, which is total, total dollar value. Umm, let's amount of ETH over here, and then we have 1,000 bucks basically, and then re-balance at, or just let's just say re-balance. [3:16]Um, when we re-balance we will have, Uh, we'll say before re-balance, and then after re-balance, so that we get an accurate depiction of how much we're actually gonna have before and after. [3:29]Uh, cause it'll be the same dollar amount, but different asset amount, cause remember our assets are being sold. Um, and then that will be $1,054. [3:37]And then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open this up in another, tab. Um, keep in mind, eventually we'll have something to kind of uh seamlessly run this thing. [3:48]Um, or you can do this geometric mean strategy and make it a lot easier on yourself. Um, but yeah, we do that.
