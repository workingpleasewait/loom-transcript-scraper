[0:00]Alright guys, I'm starting off this channel. I'm gonna be posting exclusive videos in here, stuff that you're not gonna see on YouTube, but still YouTube grade videos. [0:08]So that way you guys have some exclusive content. You're kept in the loop on kind of what I'm doing. So let's go and hop right into things. [0:14]This one is gonna be targeted towards the Solana Network. And different positions that I'm in on the Solana Network. So there's a few different projects on the Solana Network that I have been looking into, but also investing into. [0:24]Now the first one that I looked into before even bridging any funds over to the Solana Network was Camino Finance. [0:30]And the reason why is because I'm in a few Discord groups. They've been talking a lot about Camino Finance. They've been saying it's essentially like Aperture Finance where you can manage your Uniswap V3 positions with ease, but for the Solana Network and better and has a ton of other features. [0:43]Which I can agree, right? I would love to see something like this on EVM chains or even something tailored to you. [0:48]Uniswap, Aperture would be smart to implement something like this, but basically they have all these different managed vaults. Some of these are doing insane returns. [0:56]And they use the largest decentralized exchanges on the Solana Network, both Orca as well as Radian. As you can see, some of these are doing over 999% per year. [1:05]By just using the last 7 days of BData, which is great. You can also go and create your own vault. [1:10]From here, you would select a pair. So if we did something like Solana, USDC, on Orca, let's just say, and let's go ahead and choose a price range. [1:17]So with Solana currently at $73, if I zoom out and I look at the past 30- days worth of data, I'm probably gonna choose a price range down here. [1:24]Probably about $60 on the low end, and then probably about $100 on the high end. That way I can have some upside exposure to Solana, but also have a little bit of downside exposure in case I need it. [1:33]I will say sometimes this app is a little hard to navigate. Especially when you're trying to enter in like min price and max price, but if I did something like this, this is estimated to make me roughly 151% per year. [1:46]And as you can see, that puts me at a negative 18% plus 36%. So that's pretty good. I might, if I want to be a little bit more aggressive, bring this up to something like 65. [1:56]That allows me to have less downside exposure, more upside exposure. Now putting up 70% of my money in Seoul. But once again, I would only do that if I'm ultimately bullish on Solana token. [2:06]As you can see, that returns roughly 194%. At beats and permanent loss, profit against told is 195% if we use the last 7 days of volume. [2:17]If we look at the 30 days, you can see it still beats profit against told by 35% and we're still doing 71% a year. [2:25]Acculate returns over on Orco, over on Radium, and other platforms, but I'm not actually using Kamino Finance do that because it does auto compound fees, and if you guys know me by now, I don't take my fees and just compound them back into the position, I take my fees and I compound them back into my[2:39]huddle portfolio to increase my blue chip bull run bag, and then I go and I borrow against that blue chip bull run bag. [2:46]That brings me into the next platform, which is Orco. It's the largest decentralized exchange on the Salon network. Let's take a look. [2:52]Currently, Salon has a TVL of roughly 1.06 billion dollars that's not including liquid staking platforms like Marinette. It's a pretty big percentage, and it has seen a 100% change in its TVL. [3:10]This TVL has doubled over the past month, which is nuts. Specifically at the collected, claimed, and sold into my bull run bag. [3:33]So as you can see, this is doing really, really nice. Right now, using the last 24 hours worth of data, it's doing 100% APR. [3:39]And what I wanna go and tell you is this is very good because weekend days are always lower volume and lower returns. [3:46]It averages out over the past 7 days, while I'm doing roughly 180% APR on Render to Soul, which is significantly higher if I paired Render with Ethereum over on the Ethereum network.
