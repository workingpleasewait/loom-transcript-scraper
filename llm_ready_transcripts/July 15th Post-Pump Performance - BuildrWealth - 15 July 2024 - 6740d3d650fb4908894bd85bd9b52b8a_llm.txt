[00:00]Okay, so I just did a performance update. If you haven't already checked that out, I recommend you watch his about seven minutes. [00:05]Lume will allow you to speed it up. Um, but yeah, I got the ledger here. We're gonna go ahead and do some live rebalances, and I'm also just gonna do my analysis, because I literally have not done that yet. [00:14]Uh, by the way, I'm using Metrics Track. Metrics Track is available. It's now live, super excited for it. Still pump-a-bound new features. [00:21]Just MVP's live, minimal viable product if you guys didn't know. Um, but yeah, we're gonna rebound spec first, and then I'll probably dive into seeing if I should rebounce E-Clink in the world. [00:30]and we'll dive into OVN2USD Plus. This is like an entire portfolio of rebounds. I take a look over at the bank. [00:37]You'll be able to see one second here. I basically have this LinkEath one. I have Ob where I'm bar and some Eath. [00:44]I have EathSpec. I have BP and that wraps it up for about my yield farming positions basically. And I want to deploy more capital. [00:52]I want to get this thing rolling, pumping out a couple hundred bucks a day. So yeah, that's that. By the way, if you are using on a laptop and might look like this, if you just zoom out one or two, you can make it look better We're going to automatically fix that. [01:06]It's just you know something I noticed after we pushed public Yeah, let's dive into spec-eath So how I'm going to do this, right? [01:14]I'm going to go ahead and see that I've been in the position since June 18 We're just essentially three weeks. [01:20]We could go over here. That's 27 days So yeah, we want to look at 30 days We're going hit simulate, it's going to go pull up our position with the deposit amount that we want with our price range, add our current price range. [01:32]So we already know that information. And we can see that this is way too high because we haven't even got up there. [01:38]But yeah, I mean, if we take a look, where's it at, right over here, spec per e, essentially, you could see we're right. [01:48]We're not in the middle, but we're somewhat close to the middle. So we got about 40% E60% spec, sorry about 65% spec. [01:55]So we've actually lost a little bit of exposure to spec. But yeah, let's go ahead and see what we could do. [02:02]So we want to ensure that we capture these days over here in our new range. And that was essentially a peak of 676. [02:12]And we entered at 521. So if our entry was basically 521, let's just say our entry was over here-ish, we peaked up here. [02:27]We can most definitely bring this down, like 850, I mean that's coming down from 915. We don't want to get too tight to the point where we have no upside exposure. [02:44]Remember, the broader the range, the smaller the impermanent loss we're going to have. We do 840. It's not going to be a big difference. [02:51]830. Even 800. Let's do 825. Call it a day. I'm not looking at the yield yet. I'm not going to look at the yield until I do my complete analysis. [03:03]I'm going to have to. actually we're doing 60% APO. The reason why I said I'm going to have to is because I got to look at these numbers. [03:09]I probably want to have about 60% spec, I'm going to say. And the reason why is because if I dive into how much I currently have in the position, I have about 60% spec and 40% ETH. [03:21]I want to keep similar numbers because I don't want to have to do a big trade and incur a lot of slippage. [03:27]So keeping that ratio would be pretty key or at least keeping the other ratio around 50-50 volume that actually died out a lot over the pad and you know that begs a question is it shifting over to a different feet here do we need to get on a different feet here we'll check that out as well let's find[03:44]a range first drag that min price up because that can for sure go up because we haven't really gone so let's say we put this at 521 if that's like where we entered right we're above that entry price more than we're below that entry price if that makes since.
