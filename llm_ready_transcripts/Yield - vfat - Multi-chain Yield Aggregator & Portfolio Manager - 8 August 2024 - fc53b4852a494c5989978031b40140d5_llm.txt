[00:01]So if you guys, a little bit of an update on my VFAT positions as well as what I'm doing over on Uniswap. [00:06]So, that being said, about 370% APR over on VFAT, pretty good. Uh, it's 57 bucks a day, these are getting rebalanced. [00:14]Remember, these do have a decent amount of divergence loss. Uhm, I'm gonna have to kind of map out the situation, I'm probably gonna do that tomorrow. [00:21]Uh, but map out the situation of, oh, if these go back to initial entry price, here's how much money I will have, basically. [00:27]Uh, the reason why it's kind of hard is because you have this range, it rebalances. So you have to kind of do multiple positions, and I'll show you how to do that. [00:34]So like, pull up over here, Ethereum DSDC on Aerodrome, just pull up the position essentially. Uhm, and this has a range right now of 24.94, 27.57. [00:45]So, we'll just throw that in here, real quick. Uhm, and we just copy that stuff from VFAT, just like that. [00:55]Boom, that's our range. And then as soon as we go out of range, that's when we have our money back. [01:00]Essentially, and then we do another range, but let's simulate. So we have this much right now, uh, I don't know why it's not copying. [01:10]35.39, let's just say 35.39. And then when we go to our top price, which is 27.57, we get rebalanced. So 27.57, we get rebalanced, we'll have 35.89, so plus 50 bucks. [01:26]Uhm, what we could do is we just click that little share and then paste in the new thing. Grab in the new amount, 35.89, throw that in there, and then we would enter in our new range, which would be at that new price, so 27.57, uhm, default that to 1, there we go. [01:47]Uh, and then we would put our new range, which is basically from the current price, it should be, I just need to see what it is, minus 5 plus 4, so let's go and do that. [01:59]So, this is, plus 4 that we're doing here, basically, and this is minus 5-ish, kinda like that. Let me make my camera smaller so you guys can actually see. [02:11]Uhm, so then we would go and we'd do the same exact thing. Uh, ignore the APR, because now there's not as much liquidity over here, so this isn't going to be an accurate APR simulation. [02:20]Uhm, once again, copy, paste, pull it up, and over here, let's just say the price goes to top of our range, 28.72 28.72 We've got 36.21, uhm, so throw that in here, and then yet again, we will adjust the price, so 28.72, put that right there, put that right there, and then we will adjust our range to[02:47]the plus 4 minus 5, plus 4 minus 5, and I'm not doing it exactly on the dot, but I'm just kind of showing you guys back over here. [02:58]Okay, now, top of our range, 3002. Boom, we will have 35.56, right? So, here's the thing, if we would have just held the money from that initial position, let's just say, we'd have about 36.41 over here, uhm, now we have 36.56, so after two rebalances or whatever, uhm, we still, since we're locking in[03:18]that divergence loss at $52 there, $32 there, you know, so that's the thing, it's not a perfect strategy, that's why it's like if we're flipping bullish, we probably want to do a range of minus 3 plus 6 or something like that. [03:31]Not 46, 6, uhm, that's going to get us more Ethereum in the position and allow us to kind of make our money back as we go back up. [03:38]Uhm, so I'm probably actually going to rebalance that to, uh, minus 3 plus 6, APR 279%, but that way I can make sure that as Ethereum goes back up, kind of make my money back, uhm, you know, Ethereum's up 10% today, but even over the past, like, month, you could see, so, yeah. [03:55]I'm expecting a retracement back up, I'm expecting Bitcoin, I'll just run my analysis right here while we're here, Bye bye. [04:01]I'm expecting Bitcoin to go to, like, 65-ish, I'm expecting Ethereum to go to, one sec, one sec, 32-ish, uhm, and then we're either going to break through that and we're going to go up, right, or we're going to see another big dip like we just recently saw. [04:16]So, uhm, that's what I'm expecting. I'm going to go ahead and rebalance that VFAP position. Okay, so I just got done rebalancing this. [04:23]Always make sure you, number one, check slippage, and then number two, make sure that you set up your auto-rebounce after you do a manual rebalance because it takes it away. [04:30]So, if we take a look over at this, let's see, let's see, let's see, we should be good over here, showing some crazy high APR, doubt it, uhm, but yeah, so this is doing, for some reason it shows negative 5 plus 4, but I just manually rebalanced it to negative 3 plus 6, so I'm wondering if this is just[04:49]like a user interface thing, what the deal is, uhm, hopefully it's just a user interface thing because I did manually do that and I did just enable the auto-rebalance after I did that, so I'm, Thank you.
