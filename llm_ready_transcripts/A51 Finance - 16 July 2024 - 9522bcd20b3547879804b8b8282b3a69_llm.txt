[00:00]I'm going to be making a deployment into this new platform, A51, and I want to give you a full disclaimer. [00:06]So, I've been talking to this team the past one to two months, basically. They're trying to build something that's like a combination of all these different liquidity tools. [00:14]So like, for example, there's mav. xyz, and this is a decentralized exchange itself with really cool functionality, right? It has these like bull modes, bear modes, mode right, mode left, mode both, where it essentially will adjust your liquidity as the price moves and you can set all the parameters. [00:27]You can also go specific ways like where you adjust to the right or adjust to the left. Kind of like Trader Joe too, where you can have like the different curvatures to your liquidity. [00:37]So, let's take a look at what that would look like. If I were to go deploy into like, let's just say Joe Avax over here, like I can do these different liquidity shapes, a bid ask, a curve, or a spot. [00:48]Which is cool, you know, and we could theoretically do this with Uniswap, we just have to have like a ton of different positions basically, you know, where we have like most of our capital in current price, and something like that, and something like that, and so on and so forth. [01:00]It'd be a pain. Now what A51 does, is they allow you to do this essentially by just, uhm, you know, deploying through their platform, and they go and they deploy it all in the back end, right? [01:10]Uhm, so it's pretty cool stuff, and then they have these different modes, and they're also wanting to introduce like automation type stuff, like Aputure has, uh some stuff similar to Camino, like, you know, how you can deploy into other people's vaults. [01:20]Uhm, so yeah, I literally went and I chased my tail for like, uh, three hours on this thing, cause I was trying to find, uh, the actual performance, cause I wanted to be able to just take the, the contract address that's holding this position, plop it in Metrix Finance, and then be able to see performance[01:36]for this position, basically. Uhm, I even did test deposits, I even did all this. stuff, uhm, and I could not find it, right, so I was talking to the team and they basically said, uh, when you deposit through A51 on Quickswap, uh, and I'm assuming it's the same thing through Uniswap and everything like[01:49]that, cause contracts are very similar, it will not mint the NFT, since it interacts and deposits through the core contract of Quickswap, uhm, which is pretty interesting, I guess, uh, and I, I think I have heard that done before, like with platforms like Bunny and stuff like that, it's pretty interesting[02:04]stuff, but uhm, yeah, I mean, I wanted to go ahead and try this out, and they actually gave me an offer, they gave me $3600 to deploy, uhm, into this platform, so I'm like, okay, I'll take it, you know, and I'm gonna be deploying the $3600 in here, but of course, uh, as you may know, if this is a shit[02:20]protocol, I'm gonna tell you that this is a shit protocol, uhm, and I'm treating the $3600 as if I'm deploying my own capital, but of course, assuming things go well, I will most definitely deploy some of my own capital in here, it's just the only concern that I have right now is it is a low TVL project[02:33], I mean, they have, uh, basically $200,000 in TVL, uhm, same thing with Yielder, Yielder is a great product, Yielder gave me some money to talk about them, uhm, and uh, on YouTube, but again, I was fully transparent, I said this is a great product, it's a fork-of-ob, uh, but I don't like giving up custody[02:46]of my Uniswap V3 position, uh, so I wouldn't deploy a ton of capital in here, like I wouldn't deploy my entire eth-link position in here, uhm, but at the same time, I do think it's a great platform, but the market sizes are low, if market sizes were a lot higher, like, you know, I'm talking a couple[02:59]mil at least, uhm, and there'd be a lot more comfortable deploying more capital in here. Well, we're gonna see exactly how this does, I would recommend you guys wait until I deploy, you know, my own capital in here, uh, until you actually make any deployments, but definitely track my performance and[03:12]everything, because this is a good way for us to kind of see how this works risk-free. Um, so they support Uniswap, QuickSwap, BaseSwap, Linux, Phoenix Finance, finance. [03:20]7 on all these different networks. Let me pull up. Yeah, just like that. So pretty cool stuff. Um, I'm gonna personally be deploying on the Arbitrum network. [03:29]Uh, now here's the thing, right? They have all these vaults. It's hard to tell performance. I mean, there's this like, ETH to WE ETH bull run one showing like 14% looks pretty good, but then the- there was also like some stablecoin one that was showing 220% APR, which just didn't sound realistic in my[03:46]opinion. Um, and I double checked it on metrics finance with their range and it was not doing 220% APR. Um, so yeah, I mean, I'm gonna personally go over here to create my own strategy. [03:55]And I'm gonna start off my own strategy with a thousand bucks. What I always do. And I'll probably deploy a thousand bucks. [04:00]It looks into, um, what do you call it? One of these strategies that's like already existing that's showing good performance has like a decent AUM. [04:08]And I might even have to go across another networker exchange. And then I'm also gonna take the other 16 million bucks and deploy into another position here. [04:14]That would get the taste of three different positions as opposed to just one. Um, so I'm gonna show you that process because I have- No clue what I'm gonna do yet. [04:22]Uh, so I'm gonna go to create strategy. My tokens, I'm probably gonna do ETH, USDC. Uh, just because I'm interested in doing that right now.
