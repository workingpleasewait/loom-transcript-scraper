[0:00]What's going on everybody? I wanted to quickly pop in and show you a little trick to accurately calculating results using builder metrics This is an amazing tool But you need to know how to use it right because we have a lot of people that come on board and they say hey Showing 198% on ethmatic I hop[0:15]and I get 55% Cent and that's because you're not using the tool right the tool is a mathematical tool It's a calculator right you have to know how to use the calculator, right? [0:24]You have to know how to understand the equations and the numbers that it put out so with that being said let's look at This matter to a theorem pool. [0:30]I found my range 2,500 or 4,000 This pool looks amazing 1000 dollar deposit make me 5 bucks per day on ethereum pneumatic on the polygon network low gas cost like its literally perfect on the.05 percent tier as well we look at the APR 198 percent thats awesome we look over here at volume history I mean[0:47]yes there was a some big volume days over here and some smaller volume days over here so we do need to almost take that out right and what I mean by that is we're essentially factoring in these very large volume days back here yet we're not having very large volume days like this recently so we essentially[1:04]want to factor in let's just say from the start of January because that's where the consistency began so that would be roughly 19 days were gonna go and were gonna change our calculation range to 19 days put in our range again let's just say and then we look back over here and what we'll notice is we're[1:20]getting 155% now so we went from getting 198% to 155% by factoring out that old data right because were not getting that old data anymore that old data was not consistent the data that were looking at now is what is consistent so thats one thing to do make sure your volume is consistent history captures[1:37]consistent volume if you need to extend the calculation range do that if you need to narrow the calculation range do that but the volume that your getting recently should essentially make up for the majority of the overall volume history if that makes sense so with that being said im fine with this and[1:57]so forth, this is going to be relatively consistent. But what you'll notice as well is the liquidity distribution, right? So you'll notice we're still getting 155 percent, really, really good. [2:05]But if we look right here, the price, which is this pink line. Is right next to this huge liquidity block so if we move the price over just a little bit lets just say were now getting 40 percent APR which is a lot more reasonable on this pair so you need to make sure youre looking at those big liquidity[2:22]blocks thats the biggest suggestion I could give you a lot of the times there are these huge liquidity blocks but the price might be just to the right or just to the left of that liquidity block when youre calculating the pool so you end up getting results of like 155 percent and then you hop in price[2:36]reverts back to that liquidity block and youre like why do they suck why do the results suck you know what I mean well this is exactly why they suck because you need to make sure youre dragging this current price and just calculating to see what the APR would look like on that liquidity block so yeah[2:48]pretty simple concept but hopefully this guys hopefully this helps you guys.
