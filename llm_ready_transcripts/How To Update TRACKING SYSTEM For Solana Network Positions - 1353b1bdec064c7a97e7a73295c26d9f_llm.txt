[0:00]So to add Solana Network positions to your tracking system, it's gonna be very very similar as if you're just adding it on the Ethereum network. [0:07]It's just we're gonna pull up solscan. io. This is gonna be pretty similar to Etherscan, at least layout and whatnot. We're gonna head over to find the actual transaction itself. [0:16]That's where we entered into this head over to portfolio. I'll uncheck hide zero balances so that way I can just pull up the actual asset that I was using which in this case scenario I'm adding USDT to USDC so I'd pull up USDT because that's the asset that I interact least with and that's going to show[0:31]me the transactions right here so this will first show me the trade where I traded USDC for USDT and then next it will go ahead and it will show me the actual entry transaction right here. [0:41]If you have other transactions for that token it will also show them right there. But heading back into our tracking system since this to go over to the transaction hash where all the information is stored. [1:00]The first thing I'm going to do is just copy the transaction hash and make sure that I delete all of the pre-filled information on the template. [1:07]I'll paste in the transaction hash and then the next thing I'm going to do is grab the date. So this is December 15th, 1655. [1:14]date's in there, obviously you're going to need to change the date. 1 and Asset 2. So Asset 1 would be USDT, Asset 2 would be USDC. [1:21]And then we'll pull those assets in on the actual dashboard themselves. So what I'd go ahead and do is just copy this formula. [1:26]I would then go and head over to CoinPaprika, and then I would search USDT and then I'm going to grab the tag from USDT, which is right up here. [1:35]It's this USDT-tether right in the URL. So I'd paste that in right over here in the tag section, change that to USDT. [1:43]So that's B23, and then USDC is already being pulled in, but we would normally do the same exact thing if we were having to pull in USDC, basically. [1:50]So now just like that, we could go ahead and pre-fill this information. X next dollar change, that's if we're getting a reward token, which we're not. [1:57]So all my gas fees are literally less than a penny a lot of the time, so I'll just put zero dollars. [2:02]If not, I could pre-fill the gas with 1 cent, 2 cent, whatever the transaction gas fee was. Uhm, and then right over here it's gonna go ahead and show how much USDC and USDT we deposited. [2:12]So let's go ahead and put that in here. Both these assets are always worth a dollar, so I'll also go ahead and just put that as the dollar change. [2:19]And just like that, it says that we are entered, but now we need to fill out that information and update it. [2:23]So that's 4320.51 for the USDC, 4320.51. And then we'll go back over here and that is 5520.97. So that's 5520.97. [2:39]And then we also add the 72.9 on USDT, which will be pasted right here. Boom! Everything is pre-filled. It will show me all my key performance indicators. [2:48]Obviously I have 22 cents of permanent loss here because both these assets are stable coins. They do not fluctuate in value. [2:54]And this is currently worth $98.46. So like $5.99. That's just because minor fluctuations in these stable coins. Now with that being said, I have 145 of earnings putting me at an overall profit of $150. [3:06]When we look specifically at the APR, it is showing negative.01%. That's because we forgot to do something. Where it says exit, we need to do equals now. [3:15]Now it's showing this was roughly a 12% APR over the roughly 45 days that I was deployed into here. So that's not too bad in my personal opinion.
