[00:00]Okay, so I'm gonna dedicate this video to showing you guys exactly how to update your personalized tracking system. If you joined our one-on-one program, it's highly likely that we actually built you a personalized tracking system for all of your positions. [00:12]Now we also have a lesson on how you can actually build your own personal tracking system in the DeFi Accelerator course, but of course this is gonna be tailored to those that don't wanna go through that 25 minute lesson because we already created one for you. [00:23]So that being said, you're gonna wanna go over to this spreadsheet, I'll link it down below this video as well, and click make a copy, or if we've already built it for you just go ahead and open it up. [00:32]So now I've made a copy, with that being said, just name it whatever I wanna name it, and from there on out, I can go and start adding positions. [00:39]So the first thing I'm gonna do is actually pull up my wallet address on revertfinance. So I'll just go ahead and paste my wallet address in here, keep in mind this is gonna show me my Uniswap v3 pools. [00:48]If you're doing this on Trader Joe, it's gonna be a very, very similar concept. You're just gonna use this TJ template instead of the Uni template, and you won't be able to use revert, but we're strictly using revert just to find the transactions. [00:59]If you don't want to use revert to find the transactions, you can go over to DaBank, and you can go to the transactions section, and this is gonna show you all your transactions. [01:08]You would just have to find your entry and exit transactions for Trader Joe and put them in on the Trader Joe template. [01:14]Let's go a little bit further. This pool is gonna be a Uniswap V3 pool, so I'm gonna duplicate this Uni template right here, and for example, it's gonna be a wrapped Bitcoin Matic pool. [01:23]I'm just gonna name it WBTC Matic. I'm also gonna delete these other two pools because I'm not currently entered into them, or I never did enter into them. [01:30]Those are just from the template. And then from there on out, we're gonna go back over to revert. You'll see that this is my wrapped Bitcoin Matic position. [01:37]I'm gonna hit this logs button right here. This logs button is gonna show me my cash flow, my compounding, my staking rewards. [01:44]I have only deposited into this pool. I have not claimed fees yet, I have not exited yet, I have not made any compounds yet. [01:49]So, I'm gonna go ahead and open up this transaction hash, bring it up. On polygon scan, or etherscan, or whatever scan you are using, whatever block explorer, and I'm just gonna copy the transaction hash. [02:00]I'm gonna go over here to wrap it quintamatic. And once I'm on here, I'm just going to delete everything. But there is one thing that we have to add right off the bat. [02:07]Since I am still entered into this position, where it says exit action date, I'm gonna do equals, now, and then close parentheses. [02:15]That way it will show the current date and time. And whenever I type something, you can see it updates. It will also automatically update every single minute. [02:22]But I'm gonna go ahead and paste the transaction hash right over here. Just so I have it for my future reference. [02:28]Now additionally, I'm gonna go back over to the block explorer. I need to find out how much in gas fees I paid for this transaction. [02:34]So over here, you'll see current transaction fee. If we click on that, it will show estimated transaction fee on day of transaction. [02:41]If you can't find the estimated transaction fee on day of transaction, you need to go find the price of Matic at the time that you executed this transaction at, and then multiply that price by the amount of Matic you paid. [02:52]In this case, scenario, it equals 4 cents. So I'll put that in over here. X change and X dollar change. [02:57]This is going to be if you have reward tokens. In this pool, we do not have reward tokens. But let's go a little bit further. [03:03]Over here, you'll notice Asset 1 and Asset 2. Our Asset 1 is Matic. Our Asset, er, sorry, our Asset 1 is RAT Bitcoin.
