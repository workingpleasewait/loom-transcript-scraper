[0:00]Okay, so we need to make some adjustments to the tracking system to allow everything to function properly. One thing I noticed with CoinPaprika is when the bull market started coming in its APR started getting slow as well as the data that we were pulling in was kind of inaccurate. [0:14]Like one of the assets render it was just showing 7-8 dollars on CoinPaprika but renders actually at 11 dollars, so very very inaccurate. [0:23]So I went ahead and switched it up and all you're going to have to do is head over to the creating tracking system template and once you're on here, these are the updated formulas right here. [0:32]So, let's just say you have your prior formulas in the spreadsheet. Let's just say those are right there. What I would recommend you do is you start with the very very top. [0:42]So, first thing you're going to do, let's just assume that this information right here is blank. You're going to copy the API data in the link, just CTRL-C or CMD-C if you're on Mac, paste it in right here. [0:55]You're going to copy the price right over here, paste it in right here. It's going to look like this. And then you're going to need to head over to CoinGecko. [1:03]And I want to go over to, Because that's the first asset on our list. We're going to grab this API ID right here, where it says Bitcoin. [1:11]And we are essentially going to go back over, create a new tracking system, or your tracking system, and paste it where it says tag. [1:17]So that tag right there is going to be the ID. The other thing is, what you're going to notice is if we started to do AVAX, let's just say, the tags avalanche2, let's say we were to copy and paste this same exact thing, avalanche price pulled properly over here, paste this in, it shows $2. [1:33]Now the reason for that is, if we head over here, you'll see that it shows avalanche-2, there's a number in the tag for whatever reason, which is causing it to grab that number instead of the $55, so that's where you're going to want to copy this AVAX formula right here, and you're going to want to paste[1:48]it in. So this AVAX formula right here can be used for any asset that has a number in the tag, and it will need to be used for any asset that has a number in the tag. [1:58]So you would just paste that in where the price is, whereas all the other ones you would use the Bitcoin formula or any of the other formulas on here. [2:05]So if we do that, and we just go ahead and copy all this information. right here, we paste it in, and then we go ahead and we grab the tags, we would normally remember go over to CoinGecko, we would go over to the asset, we could search for it or we could just go on the list, and we would copy the API[2:21]ID right here. And then everything else is going to pull in properly. So, anything that has a number in the tag, remember you need to update that to the AVAX Anything else, you can just go ahead and use this Bitcoin formula or any of the other ones on this list. [2:35]So yeah, that's exactly how you're going to update it. Pretty pretty easy. Uhm, and assume you did it down here and you like kind of copy and paste it, you can eventually just go ahead and bring that right back up here, paste it in, and then go ahead and delete it down here. [2:46]That way you don't have to remap any data like on your actual spreadsheets over here or anything like that. All you have to do is just replace link and API data and some tags will need to be replaced. [2:56]This is CoinPaprika and CoinGecko use different tags. That's exactly how I do it and uh ask me if you have any questions, sorry for the inconvenience on this. [3:04]Hopefully CoinGecko is going to be a lot more reliable, I think it will be.
