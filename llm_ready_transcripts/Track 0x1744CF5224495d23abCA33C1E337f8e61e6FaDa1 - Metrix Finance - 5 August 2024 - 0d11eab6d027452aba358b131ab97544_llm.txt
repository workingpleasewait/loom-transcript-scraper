[0:01]Okay, so I want to show you guys exactly what I'm doing with Link to USDC. So, I'm going to go ahead and pop open. [0:07]So I did rebalance it, and I rebalanced it to an out of range position because I had a couple options here. [0:12]One, I can flip it into Ethereum to Link, so that way I have full market exposure on the way up. [0:16]Two, I can wait for it to kind of go back to my initial entry price to kind of wipe out any divergence loss I had, because if we take a look over here, you'll notice I had about 713 in divergence loss, about 200 in earnings. [0:27]By the way, that 200 in earnings was in like a day, which was really good. Uhm, but yeah, so with that being said, that's one thing, or two things that I could do. [0:36]The other thing I could do is just huddle the Link. My strategy was to essentially take, keep in mind I had 2412 Link in this position when I exited, take it and rebalance it to an out of range position, so that way I still have full Link right now, and then set that out of range position to have a range[0:53]of roughly 14 to 16 dollars. So it'll sell between those It's probably around like, let's just say a price point of $14.70. [1:02]My average starting price in this position, $9.95. So if it were to sell at $14.95, we'd grab that, we'd multiply it by $14.95, we'd have $36,000, which is more than I started in the Link Ethereum strategy that I initially got the capital from for this strategy. [1:21]It's way more than I had, $10,000 more than what I had right over here, and that's not factoring in any earnings I collect during that time. [1:28]Um, so that's a really, really cool aspect of Uniswap v3, right? This situation, it's way better. Instead of rebalancing right now, trying to get those short-term fees, it's way better to just hodl it, right, and wait for Link to go back to those price points, because if we take a look at the price of[1:43]Link over the past uhm, sorry, couple ah, couple weeks, let's take a look, three months, uhm, you can see it was right over here at $14 right before the crash, July 29th, over here it was about $14, reaching kind of around $16. [1:57]So if it goes to $16, I would have sold around $14.95, uhm, but if it doesn't go to, you know, $16, I'll still have, you know, $34,000, so, uh, which I can end up deploying into Link either, I could end up doing whatever strategy I want to with, and that's not in fact, factoring in any of the fees that[2:12]I had. So, it's better in this situation to rebalance to an out-of-range position, not focus on earning anything right now, I'm getting 0% APR, but make sure that when the price goes back up, when Link goes past my initial entry price, right, because my initial entry price here on that other position[2:30]was basically lower than $11.50. Not only do I have the capital back from this position, but I have a ton of profit. [2:35]Now let me tell you why I'm doing that, let me tell you why that's important, because if we were to dive into some of these other Link Ethereum strategies, let me just find the first one that I started with, uhm, dang, I've been running this strategy for a while, it is right here basically. [2:51]So, if we were to dive into this strategy, you'll notice I started with $33,400 in Link to Ethereum strategy, right, so, this was an average starting price of basically, Let's see, let's see how much Link was worth at that time. [3:12]Basically divide this number by $15.44, basically $14.86. So, by going back to initial entry price, I actually have a profit, as opposed to being at a break-even, as opposed to being at a loss, and that makes up for my entire Link ETH strategy that ended up, you know, towards the end of it, which is[3:28]why I switched to Link USDC, having a lot of divergence. So, that's the beauty of Uniswap V3 Liquidity Pools, I urge you to get creative right now, it's definitely a time to get creative, but basically the moral of the story is, I started with 33k in ETH to Link, when basically Link was at $14.86, right[3:49], and I traded that down, as ETH and Link did bad, as they both went down, and then eventually I flipped into Link USDC around $11.50 per Link, just so I can yield farm the high return. [4:01]And then that went out of range, converted me all to Link, I sold it at a price of around, on average, basically $10.80 or so, that was my average selling price in that position, uhm, or basically all my USDC was converted to Link, so average selling price of USDC was that, uhm, and then, I exited the[4:18]position, rebalanced to an out of range position, now I'm waiting, I'm huddling until the price goes all the way back up to, uh, basically around entry price, which is $14, or sorry, uh, to, yeah, $14.86 or so, and then I'm gonna have you know, a couple thousand dollar profit. [4:32]That's the benefit of being able to be in these Uniswap v3 pools and being able to be creative, right, and having those earnings, uh, those earnings compounded definitely helped, uh, and those will allow me to be at a much greater profit, so, yeah.
