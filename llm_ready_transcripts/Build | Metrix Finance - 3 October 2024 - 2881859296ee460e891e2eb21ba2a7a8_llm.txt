[0:01]Hey guys, I haven't really shared what positions I'm currently deployed into, but I'm gonna go ahead and reveal them right now I'm in Ethereum to ATH, um, that one's doing pretty good, uh, and then I'm also in Sol to USDC, that one's also doing pretty good. [0:16]Now, um, the one thing that I want to go ahead and talk about is I want to deploy some more capital So for the past couple weeks or so, I've had just capital sitting on the sidelines, um, in Ethereum, obviously There's a little bit in USDT, so there's like 5.6 K in USDT, about 12K, 11.5 in Ethereum, [0:35]um, and I have some miscellaneous like USDC over here and stuff like that Uh, but I want to deploy basically this $18,000 to $20,000, uh, into new positions So, some of the ones that I've been looking at are the ones right here on this list, um, so there's Parcel, there's Zeus Zeus is kind of like off[0:52]my, like, short-term time horizon, so I'm gonna delete it for now It could do very, very well, it's just right now there's not a lot of utility for the Zeus token but that's something that they play. [1:00]And on introducing they said, and they gave a couple examples in their Discord, but it's not here yet, right? So if you get it on the ground floor, well, obviously, you know, when utility does come into play, the price could skyrocket, causing you to see crazy returns, right, and then buying in later[1:15], you know, maybe it's not as good returns, uh, but also you run the risk of there never being utility and everything going down. [1:22]So, that's one thing that I've been, you know, just thinking about. Parcel's a pretty cool, uh, token, pretty correlated as well, I believe. [1:29]I'm just going to go ahead and open it. Open these all in a new tab and we'll run through them. [1:33]One main thing that I look at, correlation, right? So, correlation of the assets. Uh, this is 87%, uh, Parcel Jito Sol. [1:41]This one over here, which is H&T Sol, is 13%, so this is not nearly as good. You'll notice a swing from 14 all the way over here to 21. [1:52]Uhm, so you have to ask yourself, am I being compensated with yield? In this case, it's 65%, so no, you are not. [1:59]Uhm, so we're going to delete that one. one. From here, Sol H&T. This one used to be very, very correlated, but now it's not, not that correlated. [2:07]Uh, and then we got, oh, we got a little bit of a glitch. Sometimes if you guys get this, just give it a refresh. [2:12]It can happen if you're like opening up a bunch of, uh, things all at once. Uhm, but yeah, while we wait for that, the next one that I was going to take a look at, Jito Sol to Drift. [2:22]This has roughly a 60% correlation. Once again, not too bad. Volume has gone down a little bit on this one. [2:28]Um, and these pools have been sitting in my build page for like two weeks, literally two weeks or so. Uhm, but yeah, I mean, 170% APR, so that seems pretty solid. [2:36]That one could potentially stay. Uh, Sol Camino, volume's gone down substantially on this one. 85% correlation, no. 133% APR. This one can also stay. [2:45]And again, there could be better opportunities for these pools that I'm listing. Like, this was as of a couple weeks ago. [2:50]Sol Render's heating up, 90% APR, 93% correlation. I'm probably going to deploy into this one. Uh, keep in mind, there's some big liquidity, uh, like areas over here. [2:58]So, just a little risk that you run. Uhm, if more liquidity comes to current prices and everything. And, yeah, that is it. [3:06]Oh, there's also this, uhm, Ethereum to Render as opposed to Sol Render. Ethereum to Render does a better return because, well, everybody's migrating. [3:14]Uh, but people still trade the other ones, so, yeah. And then, 91% correlation, that's pretty solid. And that's doing about 100% APR. [3:22]So, I might deploy into this one as well. But I'll keep you guys posted with what I end up doing. [3:26]I'm looking for good entry prices on assets. And right now, I think we have pretty great entry prices. It's like, ETH is down, Bitcoin's down, uhm, everything's, like, down to an extent, I guess.
