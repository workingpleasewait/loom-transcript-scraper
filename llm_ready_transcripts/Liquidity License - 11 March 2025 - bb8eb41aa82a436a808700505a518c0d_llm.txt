[]Hey guys, I wanted to go ahead and share something, uh, and I do just want to be fully transparent here ]I do expect this to stay under wraps from you guys, so I'm really taking a chance on you guys. Please keep it private ]Uh, feel free to go over to the website, sign up for the waitlist, do what you gotta do. Uhm, but ultimately, I'm, I'm working on something that's kind of a next level metrics finance, if that makes sense ]But more focused on capital management. And, full transparency, many of you have probably heard and probably known that we plan to add capital management to metrics finance eventually, where you can kind of manage your positions and what not, rebalance and automations and all that stuff ]It's on our roadmap. Uhm, the thing is, we are going to have to charge variable fees when we release that ]It's as simple as that. And the reason why is because it costs a lot to build, it costs a lot to, uhm, maintain, uh, and it also costs a lot to get security audits and stuff like that ]We're talking in the six figures, you know what I mean? So that's more money that we're dumping into metrics finance ]Uhm, so ultimately what we plan on doing as well is introducing something that we call liquidity license, right? We're going to go out and build these things for our retail users on metrics finance, where they'll manage their positions and what not, uhm, and stuff like that ]And they'll pay the variable fees. Yes, there will be like fee discounts if you have pro, or at least that's what we're anticipating ]Uhm, but it still does not provide a good solution for, you know, people that have above $250,000 in their portfolio ]So that's where this product that we're creating called liquidity license comes into play, where you can essentially license these smart contracts ]And when you're licensing them, you'll have ownership of the smart contract. So it won't be, you know, uhm, well, it's our proprietary information, and it will be like actual legal license for using that smart contract ]Uhm, where you can't, like, reproduce and stuff like that. You will be using it, and this smart contract will be tied to your wallet address ]Uhm, and then you'll also be able to use our front end and everything like that. You'll be able to have your own server, so you have full ownership, so you don't have to worry about custodial issues or anything like that ]Uhm, but on top of that, not only will we have the automated rebalancing, not only will we have the standard rebalancing and the position management, and stuff like that, and just overall seen an aggregated view of a bunch of your liquidity positions for multiple DEXs ]Uhm, we're also gonna have some stuff that defy institutions and head funds typically keep secret and typically keep in house ]So that would be stuff like our hedging contracts, uh, for automated rebalancing on hedges, like for example if you input a position, like let's just say at liquidity ]Good evening. If you're positioning throw in the ID, um, and you'd be able to go on our DAP and create a short by just, you know, throwing in the ID and saying, hey, here's the assets, you'd map the two assets together, intern an API key for a centralized or decentralized exchange ]Um, and just like that, it would automatically rebalance your hedge and it would consistently add to your short, um, remove from your short, uh, whenever it needs to ]Uh, and on top of that, you can set different parameters. And stuff like that for rebalancing it. Um, we don't have these contracts yet ]This is very, very early stages. It is waitlist. This is like, um, the initial landing page as well. So it's liquidity license om ]I'm gonna leave a link to write below this video. Um, but ultimately I want to tell you a little bit more about it, right ]Because it would be one flat yearly fee. Um, at the start we will have quarterly fees, but, you know, the end goal is to get people on a yearly plan ]Um, and ultimately you'll- be able to access these contracts and scale upwards as much as you want, basically. Um, so if we're gonna dive a little bit further, uh, some of the stuff that we'll have is our liquidity engine, which is kind of the back end, the smart contracts themselves ]Um, basically you'd be able to deploy the same smart contracts used by top TFi investors and hedge funds, uh, to automate strategies, maximize returns, and protect your positions.
