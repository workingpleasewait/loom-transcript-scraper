[0:00]Okay so there's always kind of been this strategy haven't ever executed on it really because when I'm in liquidity pools don't really care too much about hodl's and typically I'm in correlated liquidity pools for blue chip assets that I really just want to hold and I want to have exposure to both of[0:14]them. Um but I want to go ahead and break down this strategy for you guys and then talk about how this can apply to some riskier assets. [0:20]And how this can be used ah more logistically and stuff like that so first things first we all know if you're in a concentrated liquidity pool we're going to start with the basics ethereum to usdc let's just say we're in ethereum to usdc prices like right smack in the middle we have about 55% usdc and[0:35]45% eth now in the scenario that we drag up this min price we're getting more and more eth out of usdc as you can see the reason why is because we're getting closer and closer to our min price and when we are out of range all the way towards the downside you'll see that we have 100% eth whereas when[0:50]we're out of range all the way to the upside you'll see that we have 100% usdc basically because we're buying eth on the way down and we're selling it on the way up now something that you can do here basically right you can have an aperture finance automated rebalance or sorry not an automated rebalance[1:05]pre-scheduled position close that closes your position whenever it hits like a specific price point right uhm and then that way you can you know close like let's just say you wanted to dollar cost average into eth on the way down as soon as it gets down right out of range you close the position because[1:20]you now have 100% eth you've already used all your USDC to buy eth boom you earn some fees you execute your dollar cost average now you have full eth and you're going to hold it right uh so that's one thing you can do the other thing that you can do is an aperture finance automated rebalance and what[1:34]that would be like is let's just say we have a tight range on this of something like 3300 eth dollars and then over here we have a range of like 3800 so we got 3300 3800 um okay we can even go tighter than this right 3400 to like 3700 uh or 3750 is probably a little bit more realistic we're doing 150%[1:58]right here now keep in mind we need to just adjust that volume let's use like 4 days of volume so 95% really really good on E basically well what happens whenever we instantly get kicked out of range buying permanent loss or something like that uhm well in periods where we're you know chopped into the[2:13]side like we're currently doing uh what we can do is we can have an automated rebalance on Aperture of Finance and whenever basically it goes to let's just say a price of let's say our trigger is like since our top range is 37.50 current price is 35.60 let's say our trigger is like 3700 so when we're[2:33]basically about 85% USDC or something like that uhm is when we rebalance and then what we do you'd end up doing is we'd end up doing an automated rebalance that rebalances the range to something like absurd where it's like we're way out of range we're not going back in range anytime soon uhm and the[2:51]reason why we do that is so we can have you know like 100% ethereum if we wanted to so that would look something like this basically uhm sorry I put it the wrong way around initially uhm maybe our range is like 700 to 819 basically what does that do whenever we hit that price trigger it rebalances our[3:08]position and now we have a position that's 100% eth at a price of like 712 to 819 and then when we come on the computer we see oh our position was converted to 100% eth then we can just go ahead and exit that position right it's pretty simple pretty cool now why might we want to do this well that's in[3:22]the scenario that we're like okay price is going to chop to the side let's take our eth stash let's farm with it and eth usdc something very very low risk and then as soon as it goes back to a specific price we want to get back in eth so we'd rebalance to something that's way out of range and then you[3:37]know we we start to hold our eth once again and we collected all those fees as during that time period that's one of the reasons why you might want to do this other scenario you could do it vice versa right let's say the price ends up going down to like a stop loss and this is like where we're now we're[3:51]using our thinking caps right um price goes down to something that we consider a stop loss where we want to sell out into usdc for whatever reason well we can do just that where we have like a range of 6,400 to 6,400 basically one tick or whatever you want to call it rebalances to that now we're in 100[4:07]usdc everything was converted to usdc uh so that way you know maybe we want to enter in at a better price or something along those lines uh because we don't want to you know lose further capital or something um and on ethusdc support and resistance it really really really helps right uhm but here's the[4:23]thing right here's where it gets very very interesting let's say I'm in something like spec ethereum which I currently am basically uhm and I just want to go ahead and demonstrate something real quick if I were to do one of these pre-scheduled position closes right where it closes my position as soon[4:39]as spec goes to uh a specific price or something like that well guess what's going to happen essentially what's going to happen is I'm going to have a portion in spec and a portion in ethereum right um and that's not what I want if because if I want to do a stop loss or something like that it's not what[4:53]I want basically um so what I could do is instead of doing a pre-scheduled position close I could do a automated rebalance where it basically will convert all my spec to eth because we have a price that's out of range basically we rebalance to something that's out of range so to demonstrate that let's[5:12]just say the max price is all the way over here min price is all the way over here this is our range blah blah blah blah blah now unfortunately on Aperture Finance we can't do not do like dollar prices I really wish we could uhm because if we could do dollar prices that would be absolutely golden like[5:27]this would be perfect stop loss whatever uhm but instead of like spec to Ethereum this strategy will work because spec is highly volatile compared to Ethereum basically so we can use Ethereum as a good kind of indicator basically uhm so What we could do our range is 430 to 620 essentially uh as soon[5:44]as spec goes to a specific price maybe it goes up to like uhm 610 where it takes 610 spec to equal 1 Ethereum that means Ethereum is doing better we can run that same Ethereum USDC strategy but where we go out of range and we have full Ethereum basically so we would just rebalance to something in. [6:01]Like this where we have 100% Ethereum essentially and then boom it's like a stop loss basically uhm where it converts us all to Ethereum so my thought is if there's like certain coins where you you know are providing Ethereum to to Brett let's just say or better yet Brett to USDC using USDC will obviously
