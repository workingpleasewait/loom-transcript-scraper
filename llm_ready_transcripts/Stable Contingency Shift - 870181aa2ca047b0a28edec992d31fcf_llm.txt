[0:00]Alright, so I've been thinking a lot about this strategy recently that I wanted to share with you guys, and I have a course lesson coming on it soon. [0:05]I call it the Stable Contingency Shift. Um, let's just say we're in a Ethereum to USDC liquidity pool, with 10 grand. [0:14]We've chosen our range, 1900, 2800, right? All this has already happened, and prices are $1 per USDC, $22.70 per Ethereum. [0:24]Bye. Um, and then ultimately, we go to simulate our performance. What happens? Well, guess what? Market crashes. So now we're at, out of range, say, 1900 bucks or so. [0:34]Uh, we have 8728 of, you know, Ethereum. Basically, we're all shifted into Ethereum. Uh, we don't know what to do, because we don't want to lock in all this divergence loss on the way down, right? [0:45]But we also don't want to sit at a range not earning fees. So, what do we do? We execute on a stable contingency shift strategy. [0:53]And, for some perspective, I want to show you this real quick. We go to simulate the performance. We have 8728, right? [1:00]And then, of course, Ethereum's now at 1900 bucks. So, if we were to just rebalance, right, get back in range, let's just say we were to do, like, 18, or like 1750, is our min price, and then we were to bring this down to something like 2600, even, right? [1:18]So, we have 80% Ethereum in this pool. And we go back to our initial entry price of, it was 2270 per Ethereum. [1:24]We have $9,651. We have less than what we started with. That's not, it's not good, right? We locked in a bunch of divergence loss there. [1:31]We do that 30 times over, well, our portfolio is bled to death, basically. Yes, that doesn't include fees, but even then, we're with, like, fees, you're most likely just gonna break even. [1:39]Uh, like, if you added an extra, say, $300 of fees right here, or, like, $250 of fees, like, you're at $9,951, right? [1:48]But you're still not at a profit, you're $50 off, and you comp out your fees, so you didn't earn anything in the meantime. [1:54]It was, like, really bad. Um, so, my perspective is, like, Like, what if we just stayed out of range? But then, we took this Ethereum, and we actually did something with it. [2:03]Because, what did we do? We shifted our $4,600 USDC into Ethereum, as the price went down, basically. We used that USDC to dollar-cost average into Ethereum. [2:13]That's the perspective, right? And, yeah, we can just hold Ethereum, but it's not being put to work. Well, what we could do is, we can put it to work. [2:20]And I'm not talking about 4% per year staking. correlated to Ethereum, that rises and falls with Ethereum, that does a decent APR. [2:29]Might not do the best APR, but at least we're not out of range, at least we don't lock in a bunch of divergence loss. [2:34]So, let's use Ethereum to LINK as an example. Now, Ethereum is now at $1,900. So, down from its current price of $2,270, down 16%. Well, LINK is a little bit more volatile than Ethereum, so let's just assume that LINK is down 20%, right? [2:51]So, we'd take LINK's current price, just for the sake of the simulation, and we'd multiply by 20%, we'd say, okay, we're gonna be at a price of $12, essentially, uhm, so we'd plop that in right over here, just like that, and then, all of a sudden, let's just say we chose a range of Something like $180[3:15]on the top, and $130, $135 over here. That gets us about 44% ETH, 56% LINK. [3:25]If we want a little bit more, uhm, ETH, so we don't have to do as much selling, we bring that up to $185. $50, $50, that's good. [3:31]Our deposit amount on this is going to be over here. Basically, I have $87.20. Right? And we just plop that into our deposit amount, and when we go to simulate the performance, if we go back to our initial price of $22.70, and it was $15.02, boom, $641 in profit. [3:53]Why? We lowered our cost basis over time by investing into Ethereum USDC, and ultimately, our USDC Our cost averaged into Ethereum, lowered our cost basis. [4:03]So then, when we go and we hold Ethereum up to the initial entry price, hey, even if we just held Ethereum to $22.70, we'd have $10,428, right? [4:13]It's the same strategy as that, except we're flipping from a crypto-to-stable pool into a crypto-to-crypto pool, so that way we can make more money, uh, from the fees, and also make more money from the assets appreciated.
