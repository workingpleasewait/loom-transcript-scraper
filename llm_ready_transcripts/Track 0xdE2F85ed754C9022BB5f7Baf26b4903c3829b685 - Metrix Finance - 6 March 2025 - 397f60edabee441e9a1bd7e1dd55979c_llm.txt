[]So guys, I have begun testing out some long-short strategies, basically, with liquidity pools. And the reason why is because I want to get familiar with them, I want to make sure that we're at the top of the game when it comes time for the bear market in maybe six months or so ]Uh, and also, we want to make sure that Metrix Finance is ready, right? Uh, because we want to have hedging tools on there and stuff like that, and we plan to pivot and adapt towards the bear market, make more advanced stuff ]Uhm, and I got this Ethereum to USDC position over here, it's like five grand of capital, just playing around with it, it's new capital injected ]The goal is to keep it market neutral, uhm, you can see I deposited $5,000.74, I edited my deposit to be the exact amount that I deposited, uhm, at the exact value I bought it for ]Uhm, so that's that, right? Uh, this is doing a 48% APR, nothing too crazy, it's on the Ethereum network, only because I don't really care about gas prices ]Gas fees, because I'm just, like, looking at perspective, like, hey, what if I did it with 50 grand, uhm, I have Hyperliquid over here, which I'm actually not really enjoying Hyperliquid too much, and I'll tell you a little bit more about that in just a second, uhm, but point is, like, this is at a $70[]profit right over here. Now, I did make a little bit of a mistake and oopsies, right? I accidentally bought and longed instead of shorting right over here, so, You know, I had to increase my short, right, because I started with a 1 Ethereum short, and then I had 1.14, I accidentally longed14 instead[]of adding14 to the short, which was a big accident, but that's okay, right, because I just went and I shorted it again, I just maybe paid a little bit extra fees that I shouldn't have, uhm, so you can see that this is at a $68 profit right now, and then over here, this is at a $83 loss ]It's not perfectly delta neutral, and I do think that that long kind of messed me up a little bit. You will notice that my size is 1.14, over here my size is 1.14, right, so the main thing is just like, I don't think I hit the nail on the coffin, I think I rebalanced too late ]So like. Rebalancing short on like Ethereum, I think I have to do it like every $50 or so, so like, I open this at $22.85, well then at $22.35 I need to go and rebalance my short, uhm, so it's a constant game of like rebalancing and stuff like that, uhm, I'm gonna try it on, on even broader scale, I'm[]doing a broad range with this, but I'm gonna continue to like play around with this, see what works best. If you guys have any strategies, feel free to let me know, I'm happy to dive in and test them out ]I know that some of you guys are hedging right now, uhm, I wanna learn more, I wanna see what we can put together, see what tools we can make to make your life easier.
