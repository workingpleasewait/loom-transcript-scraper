[00:00]So we are going to ignore my bug-eyed glasses. These are red light glasses. I've come to find out I look at the screen all day and apparently my screen time is like sixteen hours a day, so I might be cooked. [00:13]But, uhm, I want to show you guys something, right? I want to share something, and first and foremost I want to apologize if, uhm, you were meaning to show up to the call this morning. [00:22]I swear, I set my alarm for 9.45 when I set it on my Amazon Echo. I set it on my phone as well. I always have two sources, and usually I'll remember, like, later on if I wake up, like when I actually wake up, if I, like, snoozed and went back to sleep, I don't remember at all. [00:37]So, I'm, like, under the impression it didn't go off, but, like, I also have a standard one that's set for 10.15. I wake up at 10.15, I'm like, oh, shoot, it's 10.15. That's not good. [00:46]So, yeah, we're going to do it tomorrow. We're going to run it up. Bye. But, uhm, yeah, I want to share with some of you guys today this DeFi Portfolio Builder, uhm, you've probably seen Collins reach out to you for feedback. [00:55]You've probably seen Ben reach out to you for feedback. If you guys are actually, like, super active in the group, we reached out to our most active members. [01:01]Uh, if you want to provide feedback, and, you know, you're not as active as everybody else, feel free to just comment on this post. [01:07]I'm happy to connect you. Uhm, we're diving deep into this stuff, guys. We're trying to make the best product that we can have, uhm, but, basically, I want to show you what we have created that is going to be for the DeFi formula. [01:17]So, you've gone through the recent DeFi formula. You've probably seen, like, your little planner documents and stuff like that. They're great, but, in my opinion, they're f****** boring, and I'm, I'm sorry for being just fully transparent with you guys, but they are boring. [01:29]I mean, they're, like, little Google Docs. You have to fill out all this stuff. It's not fun. Uhm, and, really, I'm a big person on, like, interactiveness, and, like, kind of, defying the odds, basically. [01:38]Uhm, so, what I want to do is I want to show you guys this DeFi Portfolio Builder. I know I've said that ten times, so we're going to dive into it. [01:44]Uh, the first thing, which would happen, kind of, in the introduction phase, right, is to, kind of, identify where you're currently at, just our knowledge assessment. [01:53]So, here, we have a couple prerequisites, where you would, essentially, be able to rate your knowledge in each category, like, oh, I understand blockchain. [01:59]I understand the crypto fundamentals. Smart contracts and DeFi. Great. Then, we also have the DeFi fundamentals, like, okay, like, I'm pretty confident on what DeFi fund- or decentralized exchanges are. [02:09]Pretty confident on what liquidity provision is, difference between full range and concentrated, how lending to borrowing works, how staking works, right? [02:17]This is theoretical knowledge, so just stuff that is theory, just stuff like what this means, what that means, that type of stuff. [02:23]Just stuff that you should be very familiar confident with before continuing to the rest of it, right? So, this will happen in an introduction phase that we're going to be adding. [02:31]And then, after that introduction phase, uhm, obviously there's practical application, which right now is already covered in, uhm, the Getting Started in DeFi course. [02:40]So, if you're not, like, fully aware on that, uh, we would route you over to the Getting Started in DeFi here. [02:45]There's, like, the theoretical knowledge, right? And then, also, uhm, DeFi onboarding, like, setting up your browser and stuff like that. [02:52]Uhm, so, yeah, onboarding, like, browser setup, okay, that's done, good. Wallet setup, done, good. Portfolio trackers setup, like, to bank and, and step finance is what I mean, just inputting your wallets there. [03:04]Uhm, capital has been injected, know how to use DEXs and aggregators, cross-chain bridging is complete. Like, we've done that stuff. [03:11]We're confident on that. We know what to do there. Boom. So, we continue to our focus areas. So, now, it's, like, determining where do we want to put our focus, and the goal is to have you do this within the first 24 hours of starting Formula. [03:22]Uhm, so, that way, ultimately, like, you, you have a clear mindset going into things, basically, and, you know, you know what to focus on, our team knows what to help you focus on, but, perhaps, like, you want to focus more on, uhm, let's just say, DeFi platform development.
