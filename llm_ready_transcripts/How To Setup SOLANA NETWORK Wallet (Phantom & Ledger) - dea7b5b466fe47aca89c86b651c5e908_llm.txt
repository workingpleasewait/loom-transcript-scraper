[0:00]So today, I'm going to be showing you exactly how you can set up phantom wallet so that way you can start to access the Solana network. [0:06]In this example, I am going to be using my ledger wallet to set up with phantom, but I'm also going to go over how you can just use the phantom wallet. [0:13]And the benefit of using ledger is because, of course, it's the same exact device that you used on your Rabi wallet, or your Metamask wallet, or on any other EVM chain. [0:22]It's just a different app on the ledger app. So you do need to install that app on there, and I will also go over that in this video. [0:29]So let's get started. So the first step is going to be just unlocking your ledger and plugging it into your computer, and then opening the ledger live app. [0:36]So if we go over here, you'll see I could go over to my ledger, and then it's going to prompt me on my ledger to allow the ledger manager. [0:41]So I'll just go ahead and allow it to connect, and it's going to pull up all the apps that are currently on my ledger. [0:46]As you can see, I have the Bitcoin app, I have the Ethereum app, I have the XRP, er, sorry, I don't have the XRP app, but I do have the Solana app as well. [0:53]So we're just going to go over until we find Solana, and we're going to click install. So we would search something like Solana, and then we would click install, and just like that, we'll now have the Solana app on our ledger device. [1:04]The next step is going to be to navigate to the Solana app and just simply open it by clicking both the buttons. [1:09]Once you do that, we're going to navigate back over to Google Chrome or whatever browser we're using, I will mention Google Chrome is probably going to be the best. [1:17]We're gonna go over to the Chrome Web Store. When we're here, the extension that we're gonna search for is called Phantom. [1:23]Once we search for Phantom, we're gonna look for the one that is Phantom. app. It's important to do this one. I'll go ahead and leave a link to the website down below in the description as well, so that way you know that you guys are getting the right one. [1:34]But the other thing you could do is go to the Phantom. app website and go to, to download for Chrome. You're gonna click Add to Chrome, add the extension to Chrome and then wait for it to pop up over here on the right. [1:44]Once it does, it's gonna prompt you with something like this. Now if you don't see it over here, click this little puzzle icon and click the little pin icon right next to the Phantom app. [1:53]And then you'll see it right here, you click on it and then it's gonna prompt you to set up. And then once you are here, you're gonna click create a new wallet. [1:59]You're gonna type in a password. So I'm gonna type in my password right over here, saved my secret recovery phrase, click continue and then click get started. [2:07]And just like that, I'm gonna go over here. You're gonna see that your phantom wallet has been created. And then from there, you're gonna go to the little add slash connect button, click connect hardware wallet. [2:18]So we'll click connect hardware wallet. And then it'll want us to connect our ledger. We'll click connect. We'll select our nano X or whatever ledger device that we have. [2:26]But the important thing is it needs to be long. It needs on the Solana app when you do this and it needs to be unlocked. [2:31]So mine says application is ready. You guys can see that. Make sure it says application is ready. And then you'll go ahead and hit connect. [2:38]It'll say ledger nano X connected. I'll hit continue. I only want to connect on the Solana chain because I'm not going to use the phantom wallet. [2:44]For Ethereum and polygon, I'm just going to use Rabi because it's far more supported. And then I'll click connect and it's going to say connecting my accounts. [2:51]It's going to go and search through check to see if I have any Solana accounts. And then boom, we click continue done. [2:57]And we go over to phantom and you can see that I have my wallet address. It's right here. And just like that, it has been connected to the phantom wallet. [3:04]And then from there, when we go to something like orca, let's just say so orca. so, which is the largest decentralized exchange on the Solana network.
