[0:00]So we are getting a nice little pump in cryptocurrency right now I'm gonna show portfolio performance, and then I'm going to also dive into why so first of all bitcoins at 62.7k it looks like all the reasons why Bitcoin is going down like all the selling and everything like that It's shaping up a little[0:17]bit. I don't know if we're completely out of the gutter. I don't think we are I know for a fact like you know we definitely hit more recent lows basically ever since like this huge pump like beginning of this year throughout like mid-March basically we definitely hit some lows over here we haven't been[0:36]back down to like 55 that area and it looks like we're starting to recover. So here's what could happen we could see another recovery where we top out around like 68, 67 or so and then once again follow that trend where we fall back down and maybe we even fall back lower than 55 or we could be out of[0:52]the gutter and we're like good to go bull run time you know what I mean. Anyways the reason why I think the market is starting to go up right now is actually a little bit positive. [1:00]It's political you know Trump got shot over the weekend uhm and if anything that helped his polling numbers which kind of makes sense because it doesn't really you know there was like all this conspiracy and everything like that uhm and basically you know his polling numbers went up and everything Trump's[1:15]pro-crypto obviously came out and blatantly said it he's accepted like literally millions if not tens of millions or hundreds of millions. [1:20]of dollars through crypto and donations he also has like own little Trump NFT projects which is kind of funny and like you know he's pro-crypto he basically came out and said like bitcoin's great go bitcoin basically he's accumulating the bitcoin guys and all the crypto audience and everything like that[1:35]as supporters but you know none of those polling numbers have came out and they're up I'm assuming that one of the main reasons why crypto is up today is because his polling numbers are up and if it looks like he's going to win the election by a landslide then a lot of people are going to want to get[1:47]into crypto because they sense that we're going to see a huge bull run after the election now with that being said I think leading up towards the end of this year and leading up towards the election we will definitely see some volatility because no matter like what stance you take and I'm not going to[1:59]disclose kind of what stance I'm taking I take or anything like that and I don't want to get political here I could care less about who you vote for it really doesn't affect me and even my one vote does not matter in the United States at the end of the day umm some may argue differently but still I'm[2:11]one person umm but basically you know the the election years are always going to be a big big volatile year for a number one the stock market number two the real estate market number three the crypto market it's just going to be a volatile year in general we can all agree on that umm and no matter who[2:27]wins it's going to be volatile at the end of the day right umm and one person could make it be really good market the other person could make it be a really bad market or both people can make it a bad market both people can make it a good market right it could end up anyway but the point is it's going[2:41]to be volatile leading up to the election umm which is something that I just wanted to go ahead and disclose out there umm and I think that's one of the reasons why crypto is doing good right now because polling numbers are up for Trump umm and he's pro crypto and Biden isn't really pro crypto whatsoever[2:56]uhh next thing I want to go and take a look at is metric finance tracking this is gonna be published tomorrow I think it is if not the next day umm it's definitely within one to two days essentially umm at least minimal products is gonna be published and then we have another product that or not another[3:11]product uhh we're gonna take a break on the products we're gonna go back to refining some of these products first umm but I want to show you performance of my positions and actually show you the performance using metric You which track uhh because bitcoins obviously eat this up until like 15% of the[3:24]past seven days it's really good uhh soles up 15% of the past seven days link is up 12% that means that my position is doing good umm and lets take a look over at OVN It's up 2.3% today. [3:37]It's actually at 37 bucks man. I'm getting killed on this position right now. Maybe not killed but still not doing great. [3:44]Anyways lets take a look at this. My overall PL on these positions right here. Only done 1200. If you take and look at the performance like a couple days ago it was down like 3000 or so. [3:54]Versus HODL is literally 1112. Ernie's is literally 1159. Isn't that crazy? That is absolutely epic. Now granted. Reddit. 40% APR. [4:01]Not good. This spec ETH position. This needs to be rebalanced right. Uh so that's definitely gonna get rebalanced pretty soon. [4:07]I'm probably gonna rebalanced it on Monday. I was thinking about doing it on Saturday and I'm like okay. You know maybe I should just wait for this um kind of weekend to pass over rebalanced it on Monday. [4:15]Uh call it a day because typically weekends aren't gonna see much action. I could end up rebalancing it over the week. [4:20]Weekend and then boom it gets kicked out of range on Monday. So I'm like okay let's just rebalance it on Monday. [4:24]Uh this is back to 8K in capital and 340 in fees. Remember this overall strategy I started with about 14K.
