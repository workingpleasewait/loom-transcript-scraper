[0:00]Okay, so I want to go ahead and discuss what I'm currently doing in the market, right? So I'm actually like not in any liquidity pose right now. [0:09]What a switch up. Um, Saturday night I looked at my portfolio, and I'm like, this shit is ass. Like, and excuse my language, but like, I'm like, on Ethereum to Ondo, that one was like trailing in it, and I was like, you know, the the divergence loss and margin was not good, right? [0:25]Um, and then same thing on desync, same thing on render. Render had already been out of range, so I'm like, okay, this is at a, like, point where maybe I had like three, four hundred bucks of, like, loss versus hodl, right? [0:37]So it wasn't a horrible point, especially on like, you know, forty, fifty thousand dollars of capital. Uh, I think it was about forty thousand at the time. [0:42]But, I'm like, I need to do entire portfolio rebalance. So I exited, right? I exited everything. Saturday night, I'm like, come Sunday night, there's so much divergence in the market, uhm, and I'm glad I exited, right? And I didn't really mention anything I was going to mention on Monday morning, uhm[0:57], I wasn't expecting what we saw in the market. But, it's allowed me to have full exposure to desync, it's allowed me to have full exposure to ondo, full exposure to render, uhm, for those assets that I was in. [1:07]By the way, I'm still on the Solana network with, uh, this sole USDC, and then over here, this PITS, so I didn't end up exiting that one, which, this one's, like, bleeding, uhm. [1:15]But, with that being said, if we take a look over here at ondo, ondo's up 16% today, right? Saw a nice little retracement. [1:22]If we look at one month, you can see it's going back up to its fair value, uhm, if we take a look over here at render, render's up 10% today, and guys, not to mention, like, we have to factor in that, hey, it dumped from roughly $6 all the way down over here to $3, and being up 10% only puts it back[1:40]at $5, right? So, we still got a little bit to go, uhm, and then I'm also over here in desync, which is up 27% today, uh, and if we zoom out on desync, again, like, desync's getting back up to value as well. [1:52]So, with that being said, I exited, uhm, at a decent time, I would like to say, these positions, because I avoided a lot of divergence loss. [2:00]Now, All right, bye. The, the contrary to that is, like, I could have rebalanced, I could have been back in positions, uhm, not been, you know, treading on the side, basically, and then collected a bunch of fees, but, uhm, ultimately, I think what I did was, was a good play, and I wasn't even expecting[2:13]the market to dip, which is why I didn't, like, put an alert or anything like that, uhm, but, yeah, I mean, I'm happy where I'm at right now, I have about $116,000 over here, and then over on, uhm, what do you call it, uh, Solana, I have about $12.8K, and then I also have another, like, $20K of HODLs, [2:29]uh, I did take advantage of the dip, I levered up on Aave with another $3,000 borrow, and then another $1,500 of capital, uhm, that was just sitting in stablecoins, I bought ETH, right, and I'm up, like, 15% on that buy-in on ETH, I'm up, like, 16% now, uhm, because ETH's now at, you know, $2,900 or[2:54]so, uhm, so, yeah, that's pretty good, pretty solid, I'm gonna be repaying some of these borrows, and, actually, now that I've, like, kind of, like, exited pools, and I'm ready to get back in, right, now that the market's kind of, like, you know, gone back up to fair value, I'm gonna be adjusting my[3:08]strategy a little bit, and I'm gonna be giving you guys, like, full transparency on what I'm doing and everything, and, uhm, we'll definitely have a group call this week to, kind of, discuss what I'm doing in my plan, but, uhm, point is, I have a lot of options, there are so many good opportunities in[3:21]the market right now, which I'm super excited for, uhm, some of these ones, I just want to show you the performance on them, uh, to show you how crazy these opportunities are, I went ahead and, and saved a bunch of these pools to build, now, bear in mind, I do not plan on deploying into all of these, [3:35]not all of these will end up making sense, I've just, kind of, conducted my initial due diligence, uhm, done ranges and whatnot, and, yeah, we're gonna go from there. [3:43]So, I have the Ethereum to Ondo, once again, this one wasn't making sense at the time, it could be a little bit better now, we have Ethereum to Render, which, ultimately, I'm not gonna choose Ethereum and Render and SolRender, it's gonna, like, be one or the other, we have SolRay, you know, we have MPLX[3:58], which is actually an interesting currency, It's newer, it's lower market cap, it'd be a small, couple thousand dollar bet, uhm, and I would do a super broad range, I'd probably actually get about 80%, but the goal would be to, kind of, like, just, you know, ladder out as the price goes up, if that[4:12]makes sense, uhm, but, they allow you to build dApps on Solana and SVM, so I gotta dig into tokenomics and everything like that, uh, they boost, they boast a lot of, uh, good stats, like, right off the bat, like, uhm, Thank you. [4:24]So frickin' hard to scroll on their website, though, 800 million in total assets created, 8.3 billion dollars in total transaction volume, 8.6 million in total signers, right, so I gotta dive into all this stuff, uhm, their website's really frickin' cool, but I prefer a simpler website, if I'm being[4:40]completely honest, uhm, there's Soljupe, there is Ethereum Desync, SolOrca, uhm, Ethereum Link, uh, SolJLP, you see, uhm, let's see, we got Ethereum Morpho, again, Morpho, like, again, tokenomics, I'm not sure, so, that one might not make sense, Ethereum Sol, like, being a backbone, uhm, we have CBBTC[5:02]to Sol, and then IOUSDC, this IOUSDC one is, like, crazy returns, super volatile, uhm, I, the Sol one is, like, doing 40% APR, if you do IOSol, but, uhm, IOSDC, on the other hand, so, I'm, like, huh, maybe, like, a grand and a half in here would not be bad whatsoever, uhm, but, yeah, I mean, broad range[5:21]on here, so, this is 1.1 to 3, as you can see, minus 35, plus 77%, and we're looking at a 7-day calculation range that's 1300%, we look at 30 days, uh, even then, that's, like, 650%, uh, and it's simply because of this huge volume day right here, uhm, if we look at, say, 1-day, that is still 12-12%,
