[0:00]Hello everybody, hope everybody is having a good night, day, morning, whatever time it is for you. In the new place, looks very very nice from this angle. [0:09]There are some aspects that I do not enjoy. Probably already posted my complaints in the chat, but finally getting excited and being able to Get some work done obviously huge shift you know living five hours away from my parents now and five hours from where I You know kind of grew up my whole entire[0:24]life leaving all my friends behind everything like that having to go make new friends Got my girlfriend here still we rent a three bedroom. [0:32]I got two beds It's the office then I also have a bedroom no bed in the background anymore but yeah going a little bit further. [0:37]Oh, it's also freezing cold here but going a little bit further. I want to talk about a few of my positions you know first part a little off topic. [0:44]Let's hop in our communities finance aetherium to aetherium plus deployed 1660 here currently worth 2553 obviously no impermanent loss because this is aetherium paired with an aetherium derivative made 900 bucks from price 70 bucks from earnings not too bad comes out to an APR of 16% very very satisfied[1:01]with this my question is is it worth only having $2500 deposit it into here getting 16% probably not I would rather take that 2500 add it to render soul or add it to something like rapid climatic or any other position that's doing higher than 16% and is beating impermanent loss basically next thing I[1:18]want to talk about deployed 15k into rapid climatic currently worth 15400 so about 90 bucks of impermanent loss about 450 of price appreciation about 1000 bucks of earnings so that comes out to an overall 1525 profit once again very good this is ran for 37 days a solid it's been up down up down to the[1:38]point where I have you know sometimes 40% rapid coin and other times 40% matic but doing 71% APR overall profit of 10% these earnings are really really nice really like this pool right now and then moving forward orca trade a joe and aerodrome got some stable coin positions here only one that I'm really[1:53]satisfied with this trader Joe and aerodrome so I guess two out of three right there orca not really satisfied with gonna get out of this one soon just gonna find the time to find a new market neutral position if you guys have any suggestions comment them down below this post I'll be happy to look into[2:06]them the other thing I could do is just repay some of the some of the debt that I took out to actually you know use these positions because borrow rates are very very high right now like 10 to 15 percent uhm so I obviously need to be performing at least 25 percent on average on the entire you know market[2:21]neutral portfolio for that borrow to be worth it going a little bit further orko we got render to sold this one is actually at a 135 dollar loss but don't look too far I got a 2700 dollar profit on this other render to sold position so obviously that kind of balances it out this one at 681 of yield 2k[2:38]of just price appreciation profit 417 of impermanent loss that one got hit heavy by impermanent loss this one only 52 bucks of impermanent loss down 77 775 for price but 640 dollars in earnings so obviously you know when you average out both the positions beating impermanent loss by a long shot additionally[2:56]still at a very very good profit overall so very happy with that one as well on been deployed into this one for twenty one days hundred twenty percent api will mention the started at two hundred percent creep down to one twenty let's realistically probably doing like sixty seven percent right now so[3:10]i am looking to get out of this one because i could deploy into rapid climatic it seventy one percent with arguably less risky and something more stable a less mortal but i do want to include some some soul position so i might consider so used to see you something like that and just uses a bag of something[3:27]that's producing an income and then we have yield to usdc this is the leverage your uniswap v3 positions been testing this out this is in beta still getting audits deployed fifteen hundred currently worth sixteen twenty there is fifty one dollars of positive impermanent loss of impermanent gain not sure[3:42]how this is being calculated once again this is more of an income based position so I'm not even really looking at impermanent loss just here for the income I do want to mention they did fund this deposit so do keep that in mind and they are a sponsor of builder metrics with that being said I'm going[3:55]to be completely honest with the position because they only pay me to talk about it right and link them on the builder metrics website one twenty one of prize profit this is good now the thing is this is really good because thats a fourteen percent profit when you factor in the ninety two dollars in[4:08]overall earnings uhm and its like seven percent when you dont factor that in or maybe like eight or nine or something like that thats just mental math uhm but the thing that I do want to go ahead and mention is the same thing can happen to the downside you can easily go down a ton of money right because[4:23]this is leveraged essentially Im using two x leverage so I have to keep that in mind and there are liquidations so you do need to monitor it but overall two hundred twelve dollar profit pretty happy with this been running for two weeks 135% APR very very satisfied and as you can see you know across my[4:37]entire move its literally been like two weeks that Ive been packing moving in you know cleaning carpets because it smells like piss you know going to class now and all this stuff you know Ive been able to just let this portfolio do its thing yes it has creeped down from 70% to 55% mainly because this[4:54]position has died out a little bit but so has this stable coin position but still I havent had any issues I check in every single day or every other day and everything is complete. [5:04]Completely fine and then I do know if I need a rebounce I can rebounce but overall everything is performing well up to my expectations especially for not not being too active the last two weeks and I look forward to being active again I'm finally excited to get back in the group I finally got a chair[5:18]I'm no longer using the kitchen chair to work anymore so yeah look forward to to seeing what you guys think of this portfolio your guys's suggestions remember all trying to build each other up in here so I'll comment on your guys's portfolio you guys comment on mine make sure to post your portfolios[5:31]quick little loom video like this if you really want to or just tell us what you're in I'll be happy to comment on it but yeah look forward to hearing from you guys and Ill talk to you guys later peace
