[0:00]Hello team, hope everybody is doing well. I just wanted to go ahead and go over the tools that I've been using since I've been on the Salon Network. [0:07]So number one, if you want to bridge over the Salon Network, I highly recommend that you don't actually bridge your capital. [0:12]I recommend you send it to a centralized exchange. I use Coinbase in the way it draws money. Draw it from Coinbase to your salon wallet. [0:19]That way you have absolutely no bridging fees. Because since Solana is not an EVM chain, it doesn't use any of Ethereum's framework. [0:25]It's completely independent tech. They made it themselves, right? When you go over to bridge, you're going to have to pay a lot of fees. [0:33]Uhm, and when I say a lot, it's a very, very small percentage. Uhm, depending on your transaction size, though, it could be relatively large. [0:40]For example, if we bridge $10,000, USDC to USDC, you can see we're actually losing about 15 bucks. So obviously that's not ideal, and we can just send it to Coinbase. [0:48]It's an avoid losing that $15. Now obviously a 15 bucks isn't too bad. If you do like $100,000, though, that's gonna add up to roughly a hundred bucks right there. [0:57]That's just not worth in my personal opinion. And also these bridges don't have a huge amount of liquidity, so you do need to be careful of that. [1:05]And make sure you're not bridging too much, which is why I would just prefer to go and send it over to Coinbase would draw it over on the Solana network. [1:11]But let me go ahead and show you the tools that I'm using. Number one is this tool right here, Jupyter for bridging, but also I use it for swapping. [1:18]So if you guys don't know, there's a tool called DeFi Lama Swap. And it essentially routes you through the best possible trade route. [1:24]That's exactly what Jupyter does, but solely to the Solana network. See what I did there solely. But yeah, basically, if I go over here, switch your swap USDC, let's say I do 10,000 USDC for soul, go ahead and go through, umm, Lefinity, Orca, and Lefinity, and go out to Sol basically. [1:43]So it's gonna go ahead and get you the best possible route, which is great because if you just go directly on Orca, sometimes you will get a lesser value than if you were to just go directly on Jupyter and let it route you through the best possible exchange base. [1:54]Umm, and then the next thing that I'm using is another tool, this one's for tracking my portfolio. So I've been looking for something like this, and the reason why I've been looking for something like this is because Debank does not track your Solana portfolio, it just doesn't. [2:06]And if you want to, you can use Nansen Portfolio to track all of your you know portfolios, all of your wallet addresses. [2:11]But umm, there's something that's strictly Solana based, I think step. finance is pretty solid. It's going to show your latest transactions, it's going to show your wallet balance, your yield bearing assets, which I think is very cool. [2:22]Because unlike Debank, if you say stake Ethereum, it's just going to show that as a position. Whereas over here it shows you your yield bearing assets. [2:29]This is basically a hold, but it's earning 6.67% basically. And then if you look over here at liquidity, this is my actual liquidity pools, my yield farming basically. [2:38]And the other thing that I like that you can do here is if you go over to Orca, which is the next platform I'll talk about and I'll go deeper into this in just a second and you go to your portfolio. [2:48]You cannot claim fees from one position. There's no claim button, right? If you withdraw, it's going to claim that yield, but you have to withdraw. [2:54]You have to do a 1% withdrawal, which I don't want to withdraw a hundred bucks. From this, why would I want to do that, right? [2:59]You can click harvest all, but that does it from all your positions. So over on step, you can click claim right here and it'll claim it from a specific pool. [3:06]So that's what I just did for my render to sole position, which is currently doing 152% APR. So this is a cool little tool for just being see over the next 12 or 24 hours, I'm expected to make roughly $41 over the next 30 days, I'm expected to make 1250 bucks. [3:27]So that'd be great. But getting into it, I've been providing liquidity. The Excuse me. What's up guys. 100% and keep in mind this uses the past 24 hours of data to calculate this return and it's the weekend So this is gonna be higher on weekdays. [3:54]That's something I want to mention M sold the soul which is basically just staking soul you can get 20% on stablecoin positions 25% these are really really good returns personally I will do a portfolio update in the DeFi strategies right after this but uhm, I'm in render to soul and USDC to USDT basically
