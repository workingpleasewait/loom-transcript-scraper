[0:00]Okay, so if you use our tracking system template, you're probably going to notice that a lot of the price data will look like Hashtag N slash A basically, um, having issues pulling in the price data. [0:10]Same thing, you know, it's going to affect all this information, obviously not ideal. So the reason why this is, is because Coinbase Paprika, the place we pull all the data from has kind of switched up the way that data is pulled, right? [0:21]So what we need to do is we need to update the formula. There's an easy, easy fix to this. All we have to do is go over to the DeFi Accelerator course over here, and then we're going to go over to the section, phase 2. [0:32]Phase 4. And then we're going to go over to create a new tracking system. Now once we're in here, here's exactly where you're going to find the template. [0:38]You're going to open up the template, and you are essentially going to copy and paste the new formula in. So you could just go like this, basically. [0:45]You go over to your tracking sheet, and you start at the top. And then you can drag that down basically, and it's going to update all the formulas basically. [0:53]So that's all you have to do. Literally just copy and paste the new formula that's on the template now into your tracking system, and then it's going to be fixed for you. [1:00]And if it isn't fixed, then please shoot me a message and we will kind of work things out. The other aspect is you can go ahead and just kind of re-input things like copy this whole thing, paste it in, and then uhm you know re-input the other assets like with the tags and stuff like that. [1:14]But it should be a very very quick fix. Sorry about this inconvenience, once again we are building our own tracking tool. [1:19]This could be web-based. And all you have to do is enter in position, it's going to be pretty cool. So yeah, it's exciting for that. [1:23]And um, let me know if you have any questions. Peace.
