[0:00]So, I'm gonna try to get in the habit of doing these updates every single day on the portfolio. Uhm, probably miss a couple days, but let's go ahead and talk about what we are doing today. [0:09]So currently, positions are down to about 13.13, or down by 13.13 right now. Uh, 238 in overall earnings versus HODL is about 153. [0:19]Uhm, still doing about 100. 132% APR, the other day this was about 135% APR. Now with that being said, this spec position right here is obviously the best performing position, but one thing that I wanted to go ahead and mention that I didn't really notice and I was kind of confused at the start was my[0:33]position actually did get rebalanced. We hit that rebound trigger. Now to take a look at what happened over here, uhm, when we got rebalanced, one sec. [0:42]So basically we deployed 10,070 bucks, that was including compounded fees. We were able to withdraw about $10,700 plus the $53 in earnings, which is great. [0:53]Uhm, and then that came out to roughly an overall profit of $680. Here's the thing, Versus hollow is negative 73. [0:59]There's a hundred and twenty twenty-five dollars of divergence loss, which keep in mind, we were expecting on this rebalance, and then essentially we locked that in because it, you know, went above that threshold for that period of time basically. [1:11]Uhm, so we locked in that divergence loss, we compounded that $53 in fees, uh even after that $53 in fees, it was negative $73, so obviously we got beat right here. [1:20]Uhm, and the other thing that I want to go ahead and take a look at is this chart, it would actually help to pull it up over on the correlation chart, uh so let's pull up simulate. [1:29]Okay, so it looks like we got rebalanced like right around here, like the current price point was kind of a rebalanced trigger, I think it was $4.08, and if the price was like $4.10 over here, and yeah, I mean there's a good period of time where it was $4.08, so maybe here we could have had a longer[1:45]time threshold, like 12 hours, because it looks like it's starting to revert back upwards, uhm, nonetheless, this was a period where SPEC was doing good, which is why uhm, you know, we're at a decent profit, and I believe SPEC still is doing pretty decent, I know the market is down today, we saw a little[1:58]bit of retracement, uhm, but still, really, really good 7 days for the market, once again, I don't think we're out of the woods quite yet, uhm, 7 days, as you can see, SPEC has done really well, we're sitting at right above $8, and really, I'm just trying to print yield, I mean, the faster I can print[2:12]yield, the faster I can start to make my money back on this position, and it seems like it's working, so, what's the plan of action here? [2:18]Well, the plan of action on this new position, which is right here, is to literally hold it out, uhm, actually, that was the wrong position, that was the wrong one, we want to look at this one, is to literally continue to hold it out, right, because this is the broad range position, so, taking a look[2:33]at what this one looks like, I'll show you in a sec, but it started with 66% SPEC, I now have 69% SPEC, so I've lost, or I've gained a little bit of exposure to SPEC because SPEC has retraced a little bit more than Ethereum, this one is at a $15 profit compared to Divergence Loss, we have $22 in earnings[2:50], doing 170% APR, as I mentioned this is a very broad range position, uh, to take a look, just like that, I mean, I think we'll be perfectly fine staying in range, uh, and I do hope that SPEC does outperform Ethereum, because if it does, this range is going to work perfectly, we'll continue to collect[3:06]fees, um, and I'm getting a really really good APR right now with a super broad range, uh, and this APR will most likely drop as, you know, there's not as much trading activity and everything like that, um, so far so good, I mean, we got rebounced, at one point in time, we had about $10,800 in this position[3:24], uh, or sorry, $10,000, yeah, $10,850 in this position, which is really good, um, and yeah, I'm really just hoping to recoup losses on this, uh, so that's how I'm playing it, I'll keep you guys posted when I make an update to this one, next one that I want to go ahead and take a look at is going to[3:37]be the USDT TON one, it looks like this one is the same one, it hasn't got rebounds quite yet, um, and yeah, I mean, we are down $200 assets depreciating, we are up $46 from earnings, we don't have the best earnings to impermanent loss ratio, however, in this situation, where, um, we, you know, kind[3:58]of stay with this current impermanent loss or just bounce around. you know, maybe consolidate, uh, and these earnings continue to pile up because it's 132% APR, that most definitely outweigh that impermanent loss, remember, very early on into the position, um, but still, this is doing solid and this[4:12]is expected to make about $1000 a month, um, so yeah, no, no complaints here, uh, we did start with 55% ton, we now have 73% ton, so we're actually, probably getting to the point where this is about to get rebalanced, I'm gonna go ahead and take a look over here, uh, our rebalance trigger is below $7.15[4:32], currently, okay yeah, currently we're at $7.20, and it has to stay below $7.15 for 7 hours, so, let's go let's make a decision to see if it's something that we want to adjust on that time frame, uh, cause adjusting on spec definitely could have helped, uh, so over here, uhm, no we haven't gone below[4:53]$7.15, so I'll watch this one throughout the day, uh, since you see how it does, uhm, but yeah, that's that, uh, remember, uh, if we, uh, basically go down to $7.15, and we like lock in and permit loss at that $7.15, we're still basically beating, uh, this hodl over here, cause we're already beating[5:10]it by $12, which is good, uhm, and this is expected to make, yeah, as I mentioned, about a thousand bucks a month, next position I'm gonna dive into is this ETHlink one, ETHlink, once again, uh, this is still doing very, very good, $170 in earnings, that's $120 profit versus hodl, 120% APR, yes we're[5:29]down $850 from the assets falling, uh, that nets out to about $675 after you factor in the earnings, uhm, I'm happy with this, no complaints here, this is doing really good, over $3,000 a month, uhm, and then the next thing I was gonna take a look at was gonna be these A51 positions, so remember they
