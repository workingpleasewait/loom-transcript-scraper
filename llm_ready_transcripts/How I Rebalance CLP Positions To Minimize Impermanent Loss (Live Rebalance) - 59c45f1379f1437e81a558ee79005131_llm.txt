[00:00]So in this video, I'm gonna be showing you guys exactly how I rebalance a position, whether it's Uniswap v3, whether it's Trader Joe, whether it's Orca, whatever it may be. [00:08]This is the process that I take to rebalance a position. The first thing I'm gonna do is determine my metrics and determine my key performance indicators. [00:16]So this position that I'm gonna be rebalancing is Render Soul and granted I probably should have rebalanced it last night because now I have $45 of Soul and $9.2k of Render and last night I probably had $1,500 worth of Soul, that would have been the time to rebalance. [00:31]So a little bit of a mistake on my part. But when we look over here you can see I have $430 of Impermanent Loss, I've made $18.87 from price action, and I've made $677 from earnings. [00:42]So I have beat Impermanent Loss by roughly 50%. I am happy with that. Additionally, I probably was not going to hold Render or the $9,000 of Render and the $9,000 of Soul in my wallet. [00:53]But Impermanent Loss is still a good metric for me to beat and I'm happy beating it and I always want to try to beat it. [00:58]But with that being said, I'm up $2,500 overall so I am happy with the results and I'm still beating Impermanent Loss. [01:04]So what do is go determine if there is a better feat here that I can get in on. So first things first, we're gonna search Render over here and we're gonna see, okay, well I'm on 1% feat here, this is showing 0.573%, over here on the 0.3% it's showing 0.712%. [01:21]But the thing is, you can see the liquidity difference. There's 1 mil over here and there's 185,000 over here. Additionally, you can see the 24 hour volume is 385,000 compared to 580,000 on the 1% tier. [01:34]So yes, they are charging a higher fee on the 1% tier. But at the same time, the volume is just roughly 50% more on this 1% tier so it's something to keep in mind. [01:44]I'm probably gonna switch over to this render sole on the 0.3% fee tier. Another strategy you could do is if you're kind of unsure, you could do half and half or kind of break up your liquidity. [01:53]But ideally, I mean, I'm getting a, let's see, a 225% APR on this position, I wanna still get around 225% APR on this position. [02:01]So let's go ahead and take a look over here at deckscreener. We'll search render, and then we're gonna find render sole, just like that. [02:09]We're gonna go back over to Orca and determine my current range. My current range is 0.458 to 0.647. So I wanna make sure instead of looking at this in US dollars, I'm looking at it in soles. [02:20]So we have 0.458 and 0.647, so down here we're at, 4, 5, 8. I'm just creating a horizontal line of where my range is, and then over here we're at 6, 4, 7. [02:34]So we're all the way up here. So it's safe to say that I can bring this top range down a little bit because when we look at this chart, in all of existence that this pair has been, you know, open for or, or available for since November 28th, you could see that it would have been in range. [02:50]So first things first, I'm going to bring down this to, like, probably about.6. Normally I would bring it down to, like, from 6, 4, 7. [02:57]Something like 6, 3, 7. Just bring it down a little bit. But in this scenario, I'm gonna bring it down a decent chunk. [03:03]Maybe I'll do, like, you know, probably do, like, 6, 2. And the reason why I do that is because normally if there is a retracement, then I wanna make sure that I'm still in range if there is a retracement. [03:14]But in this scenario, there is such a huge pump, even if there is a retracement, chances are the retracement is not gonna be all the way back up here. [03:21]Right? So let's go ahead and zoom out a little bit. We do need to bring this 4, 5, 8 down a decent chunk. [03:30]Here, and we do something like 3, 6 or something. That would be good in my personal opinion but let's go ahead and calculate it, see what we're returning. [03:39]So we have 3, 5, we'll just call it 3, 6 to 6, 2. I am gonna pull up Render Soul on the 1% tier and look at it and then look at it on the 0.3% tier as well. [03:48]That way I could see what I would be doing on a daily basis compared to what I'm currently doing. The first step though is to enter my current range. [03:55]You're gonna be like, well why are you entering your current range? Because it's kind of hard to estimate data on this to see how we would actually do because it only uses 24 hours of fees.
