[0:00]I wanted to go ahead and go over this LUSD to USDC pool that have been doing really good for me. [0:06]So I essentially have about $16,000 in here and Basically, this is all through loans or at least the majority of the capital is through loans. [0:14]So over on off. I'm borrowing roughly $8,800 at a 5% interest rate and I'm borrowing against my rap stick to theory. [0:22]My rap Bitcoin and just some USDC as extra collateral. So these are essentially assets that I was holding in my wallet, mainly because I'm staking Ethereum. [0:30]I'm holding Bitcoin. I do have my hotto portfolio. You outside are Ethereum and borrow Bitcoin is going to be investing to stablecoin pools. [0:52]So I'm paying 5% to borrow USDC and I'm getting roughly 25% on this pool, which is great. And I essentially have like a, I want to say like 50% if you know that loan devalue ratio, maybe it's like 35% loan devalue ratio. [1:08]Which is nice, but I have over here a deposit of 16, 154. It's currently worth roughly 16, 163. So I made what, 10 bucks for a price action. [1:16]Not too bad. Not really taking that into account. What I'm taking into account is that I've made 95 dollars from overall earnings in the past about eight days by now, which has given me a 26, nearly 27% APR. [1:29]I do want to mention that this is on the theory of network. I did pay $22 to get into this position. [1:34]So that brings my overall profit loss from being basically $103 to roughly $90. So you do need to take them into account. [1:42]This is going to be for the larger position sizes, but it is a pretty efficient strategy in my personal opinion because it is, you know, a bar against my blue chip assets. [1:51]My assets are still in the market, but it's a essentially leveraging up in a safe way, if that makes sense. [1:56]And yes, I could borrow like 75% loan to value make even more money, but then, you know, I run the chance of getting liquidated if there is a black swan event in crypto or something along those lines. [2:05]So this is a great pair for anybody that's interested. My range is this right here. 1.0026LUSD per USDC and then 1.00662LUSD per USDC. [2:17]And I will say this does occasionally get kicked out of range, but it usually pops right back in because LUSD is going to fluctuate a little bit. [2:24]It's essentially a stable coin. It's a pretty interesting concept. If you guys do end up deploying into this pool, let me know down below in the comments. [2:31]I'm eager to see how it performs for you. Talk to you guys later. Bye.
