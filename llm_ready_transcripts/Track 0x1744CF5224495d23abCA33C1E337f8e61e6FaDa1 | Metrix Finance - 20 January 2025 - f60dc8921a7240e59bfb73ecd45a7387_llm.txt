[0:00]So my gravy train on the, uhm, Ethereum to Aetherpool is starting to run a little dry. Uhm, it's doing good. [0:09]Like, it's down 3,300 right now, but like, overall the strategy's doing good. But we have to look at individual positions, not just strategies. [0:15]This APR, 150- 23%. Recently, it's doing a lot less. Uhm, sorry, I got a timer. It's doing more like 60, 50% or so. [0:25]Like, right now, 60%. it's like 100% APR. It's not bad, uhm, it's not great. Uhm, now, I have, like, Render, which is doing good, up to my satisfaction. [0:40]Uh, Desync's not. Desync is, looks like it's getting wrecked or something like that today. Uhm, it's like to log in to see this today. [0:48]Uhm, yeah, I mean, I'm waiting this one out. Still doing 165% APR. Uh, it is losing versus holo right now. [0:54]But, one thing I wanted to mention is I'm looking at some new cryptocurrencies. I'm just gonna shoot what I got. [1:01]I got AIOZ, if I can, like, get this on the tab. AIOZ, it's similar to, uh, Aether, actually, and Desync, and Render, and all the same things. [1:10]It's Deepin, uh, decentralized physical infrastructure. Uhm, it's hard to find, like, revenue numbers on that. There is Edge, which is actually a $45 million market cap. [1:20]If I go in this, it'd be with, like, five grand. Uhm, it's like, uh, I don't know how to explain it. [1:27]Something, I mean, it's Deepin as well. Uhm, and yeah, it just seems like an overall interesting thing. As far as, like, performance on this one, uh, three months done very, very well. [1:35]It's up 6.5%. 6.8% in the past 30 days, 9.56% in the past year. So it's been around for a while, it's just really hasn't got the recognition until recently. [1:44]Uhm, so yeah, that's one thing that I wanted to just put out there. Uh, and then over here, one month, even one month's been solid. [1:53]as far as supply goes, it's like, there's a lot more minted. Uh, Ondo, this is real world assets, so this isn't dpin. [2:00]Uhm, yeah, they have like, institutional grade finance on chain, so like, USDY, which is their US dollar yield, is 3.84%. 3.5 million there, 190 million in treasuries. [2:10]Uhm, you gotta just figure out how Ondo ties into the ecosystem. Uhm, again, I'm still doing due diligence on this. [2:16]I'm like, asking for you guys' feedback. Tell me what you're in, what's doing well, what's not doing well. Uhm, you know, Ondo's a multi-billion dollar market cap asset, 4.2%. 2 billion, uhm, still has some inflation to go, it looks like. [2:28]Morpho, it is a limited borrowing platform, 584 million. Uhm, if we take a look at this, uhm, so yeah, it's an infrastructure for on-chain loans, 6.1, and deposits. [2:40]2.3 in borrows, yeah, uhm. They essentially allow you to create markets, so for example, if I go over to Morpho, I can, uh, create a market, I believe. [2:51]I believe that's how it works. Like, they have, uh, Spark Dive Alt, uh, MEV Capital, and capital use, uh, usual, USTC, stuff like that. [2:59]Um, so they support, like, the majority of these, like, big protocols, um, from my understanding. Now, there's also O-R-A, which is 50 million dollar more caps, so again, 5k, uhh, uh, this one hasn't done well over 3 months, so it is a hard look. [3:15]It's also down a bunch today. Um, I was actually looking at this now today, it's down a bunch, so it's like a little concerning. [3:22]Um, but, let's see. Tokenizing AI models, enabling AI smart contracts. [3:34]So they basically bring AI in smart contracts. Um, let's see, there's also safe. Safe is great. Uh, it's like you can have a smart wallet. [3:42]Uh, number one, smart accounts. Now it's, Number two, so there's the B2C and there's the B2B, which is why I really like safe. [3:48]Um, the B2B is like, say, metrics, finance, we wanted to release where, uh, people could like, uh, basically rebalance and stuff like that. [3:57]And we wanted to charge a fee for that. Well, obviously it doesn't make sense to just- I'll video. And that fee to my metamask wallet or send that fee to, uh, you know, like a ledger wallet or something like that.
