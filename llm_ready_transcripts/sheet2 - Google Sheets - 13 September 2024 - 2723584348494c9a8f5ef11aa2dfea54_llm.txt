[0:00]Hey guys, just, uh, I built out a little new, new spreadsheet for tracking. I'm not going to release it yet, or I will. [0:06]I'll link it if you guys want to try it out. It's nowhere near done, and I don't feel comfortable officially releasing it, because it, it kind of sucks for the time being. [0:14]But, uh, it's supposed to be like Metrix Finance is, but spreadsheet version, where you can, like, kind of do your own input, basically, uh, for positions that Metrix Finance doesn't quite support yet. [0:25]Which, I know I've been saying this for a while, but I think we're actually, like, wrapping it up on Aerodrome Belladrome. [0:30]So, you'll be able to, like, paste in VFAT address, all that stuff. Pretty cool stuff will come soon, uhm, but I wanted to show you, basically, what I got over here. [0:39]So, I got 21.479 Sol, 479, uhm, and then over here, let's see, I got about 1987 USDC, 1987. [0:52]The yellow inputs are, like, where you actually do an input, basically, uhm, and the rest will be based on profit loss. [0:59]and then 0.303. So, 0.3006, and then over here we have, basically, 39.5. So, 39.5. [1:11]Boom! So, we are basically doing a 67% APR on sold USDC right now. Uh, we deployed 48.57, it's currently worth 49.04, plus $80 of earnings. [1:20]I'm pretty happy with that. Actually, I haven't even added the automated prices yet, so, this is inaccurate. Let me throw that in. [1:28]We are at 49,000. 49.49. There we go. Okay. So, we're actually at $173 profit. That's 3.5% when you factor in the gains as well. [1:38]Um, about 73 bucks versus HODL, because there is about $7.59 of divergence loss. So, I think this is performing quite well, in my honest opinion. [1:48]Um, and I'm pretty happy with the results that I've got from sold USDC so far. Now, what's the plan here? [1:53]Well, the plan is to probably ride this up a little bit longer, ride it up to maybe 145, and then go from there, because at 140, I'm gonna have a little bit more divergence loss. [2:02]I gotta make sure the earnings are making up for it. But, um, yeah, this is a pretty good play, at least for now. [2:07]Uh, it might increase capital, I might not. Um, yeah, I'm doing a little bit of a rebalance to my overall portfolio, so I'll have a meeting scheduled, um, next week, pretty early next week, where we'll go over, kind of, what I'm gonna be doing with my personal portfolio. [2:20]I'm in this USD Plus to USD T1. This one is doing good, yes, but there is a little bit of caveat, which is, I started with, and I'll show you. [2:30]Basically, I started with a total of $22,117, and if we take a look over here, you'll see that I currently have a total of $22,148. [2:44]So, I have, like, plus $20, plus $30. Okay, so, it is making, making sense now. The math is now mathing, cause, um, before, it was not mathing. [2:54]It was, like, really weird. There was, like, some slippage or something like that. Or actually, no, it's, okay, that's why. [3:01]It's showing this $22,076 USDT is worth $2,209.7. So, if we add that together with the USD plus that we have, which, keep in mind, can be redeemed one-to-one, we have, basically, a $10 USDT profit right there. [3:15]And then, we have $11 in ARP incentives, and there's $30 in fees earned. So, basically, what I'm noticing is there's a lot of slippage in this instance, right? [3:26]And you do have to end up rebalancing a lot, because you have to go back to the rewarded range. Rewarded range constantly changes. [3:32]Uhm, so, yeah, that's something to keep in mind right there. And, one thing that you can also do is just look at the, uh, bins that are traded most often. [3:44]It should show that. I don't know why they're not showing that right now. They used to have this. Maybe they made some changes to this. [3:50]I used to be able to see exactly how many bins, or, like, which bins were traded most often. I don't know if this USD plus, USDT pool, it's doing alright, but I don't know if it's holding up the actual return that it's saying that it's doing.
