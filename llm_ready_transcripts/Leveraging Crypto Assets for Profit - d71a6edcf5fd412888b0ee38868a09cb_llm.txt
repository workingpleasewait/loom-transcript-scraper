[0:00]So, late last night, uhm, sorry guys, I'm still getting over being sick again, uhm, late last night, I locked in a little bit of a leverage position. [0:09]So, over on MarginFi, I currently have, or I had, basically, mSol and Render. What I did is I went and I borrowed $2,000 of USDC, which at the time, this was worth, like, $2K. [0:19]I brought $2K of USDC, converted that into Sol, instantly, and then put that Sol as collateral. So, this $13.14 Sol, I'm at, basically, a $183 profit on it. [0:30]And the cool thing is that $183 profit, I didn't have to put $2K in, I just used what I already had. [0:35]Did the same exact thing over on Ave, with some Bitcoin, basically, Bitcoin's up, like, 2%. Um, and if we take a look at this WVTC, so my debt's seven, or actually I locked in 7,500, apparently. [0:50]Didn't even know that. As you can see, late last night, that's why I didn't make a post. Um, I basically got 0.1105 BTC, um, so if we take a look at that, uhm, .[1:02]Let's take a look. My current. So, my initial was, like, .167. Uh, and then let's see how much that's currently worth two day. [1:14]Over here, $76.60, so I made $160 bucks there. About the same that I made on Sol, except Bitcoin didn't go up as much. [1:21]Um, but yeah, obviously, pretty decent strategy. Um, I'm holding these because the elections today. I sense that we're gonna see a pretty good run, so I just wanted to leverage up a little bit. [1:30]Get a little bit more exposure without dumping more capital into it. And this is my hodel portfolio anyways. I'm not barring against it. [1:37]Um, regardless of what happens, like, it's $7,500, um, against, like, you know, at the time, it was $32,000, but then I put that back in collateral, you know, so it works out quite well. [1:48]But yeah, just wanted to share that show. Yeah.
