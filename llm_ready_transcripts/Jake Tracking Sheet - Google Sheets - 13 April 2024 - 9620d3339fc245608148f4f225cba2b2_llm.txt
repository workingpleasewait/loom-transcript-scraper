[0:00]Okay, so we are in the midst of kind of like an entire market crash, and I'm gonna go ahead and go over my positions, how those are performing, and why I actually think of the markets crashing, and when I think we're gonna be seeing that rise back up to uh previous price points against let's hop in. [0:16]Market is down 6% today, Bitcoin's down 2.3% in the past 24 hours, 2.5% over the past 7 days. If you're gonna get hit harder at around 4 to 4.5% sold, getting hit really hard, down 15% on the 24 hour. [0:32]And then down 22% on the past 7 days. And think one of the reasons why soul got hit really hard is strictly due to the fact that umm a lot of the slana transactions have not been going through. [0:43]You know, I got out of the salon network mainly because of that reason and I think now it's to retrace. [0:48]With that being said, I had a stash of soul that I wanted to sell for matic around $180. Uh I started the unstaking period on coin base and you know I didn't get it in time. [0:57]And I'm like thinking oh why could still sell that soul for matic considering matic is down a similar amount. Uh but matic's down 12%. [1:04]So technically I would be kind of having some sort of some sort of loss of assets there if I did sell. [1:09]Um so I am gonna wait for the market to kind of rise again. Uh and then that's where I'm gonna execute a sell. [1:16]Uh of Solana for matic. But um that brings me into the next point. A-vax is down 15% 26% in the past 7 days. [1:25]Matic is down 12% 20% in the past 7 days. So believe it or not. Matic is doing the best out of Sol as was A-vax which is surprising but it also just didn't go down as much. [1:35]Additionally link is- it's taking a huge hit. All these other altcoins uni token as well as um. Mantle, um cronos, uh bent tensor, arborchrum, rindor, gert. [1:48]All these guys have taken a huge huge hit in the past 24 hours in the past. So as far as how my positions are performing, not too good. [1:57]Um as you can see I had a huge earning day yesterday, I had roughly $230 in earnings that I made which is great but I did see a huge de-climate overall position value. [2:07]So, first things first. This matic link one is actually doing uhh basically the best I would say. So if we go ahead and pop into this one, yes I am down, $4,000. [2:16]Uhh this is one that I'm holding out and this is one that literally has $2 in permanent loss on a 18, 19,000 dollar initial deposit. [2:24]Now with that being said, it is doing about a 30% APR so some considerations here is maybe I can keep the same exact asset ratio but go with a little bit tighter of range so that way I could get a higher APR to kind of make up for some of those uhh. [2:38]I guess losses but additionally the other aspect is I could just wait for these assets start to rise again and when they do start to rise again well then that's where I'm gonna recoup those losses I guess you could say. [2:49]Umm but yeah as you can see your earnings went from I guess doing 25 bucks a day to like doing 10 bucks a day because more look where they came in volumes were down and then all of sudden doing like 37 40 bucks a day umm so yeah hopefully I'll continue to earn those earnings and that will kind of help[3:04]hedge out some of that and shall loss overall remember whenever you are in liquidity pools on the way down you collect all the fees you also collect all the fees in the way back up so if you're thinking those assets are going to go back to your initial entry price or something like that uhh like I personally[3:19]think Madak and Link are going to go back to the initial prices that I entered that well then I just collected all those fees in the way down all those fees in the way up and I'm back at a break even on my initial principal assets so that's a hope here and I think that's something that is going to happen[3:34]. And then if we go ahead and take a look at some of these other positions, render e this one is sitting at a range this one got hit pretty hard too so I actually deployed $10,000 like on the dot and here it's currently worth like $8,250 so down roughly $17,600 just from the price decline and I do have[3:53]about 170 bucks an earnings. When we compare that to impermanent loss that's about $472 in impermanent loss so not too good of a issue here whatsoever. [4:01]I am sitting on a range on this one so my thoughts here are like okay well number one I could rearrange. [4:07]I am gonna finalize some impermanent loss but we will have to kind of calculate it and see exactly how much impermanent loss would be finalized and how long you would take to make up for that impermanent loss. [4:16]That's consideration here and something that I do and I always do this is I never make decisions on a whim.
