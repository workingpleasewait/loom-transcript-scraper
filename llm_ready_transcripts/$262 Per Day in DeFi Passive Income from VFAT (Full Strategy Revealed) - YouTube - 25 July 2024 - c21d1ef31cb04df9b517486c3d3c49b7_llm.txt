[00:00]Okay team, sorry for the um crazy lighting today. It's like, I like the natural light. My window is right over there. [00:07]And then there's like a door and a wall right that way. So when I have the window open, one face is like super bright and the other's not. [00:16]Maybe if I turn on my studio lights. But um anyways, let's dive right in. So I'm going to be deploying about $8,000 into VFAT. [00:23]Yeah, that works better. Um, but yeah, I'm going to be deploying $8,000 into VFAT. and I made a video on YouTube. [00:30]By the way. Hey guys on the YouTube videos, I know a lot of you like watch my YouTube videos before joining the Accelerator Program. [00:35]There's still value on the YouTube videos, right? And I try to put as much value as I do in YouTube videos in here, you know, if not more, right? [00:42]Um, so there are some stuff that I keep like exclusive to the Accelerator and stuff like that. There's other stuff where I'm like happy to share on YouTube. [00:48]Um, overall, like it's a win, win, win. Let me know what you guys want to see in either or, you know, cause I'm happy to do both. [00:54]Um, but I recommend you always watch those too. So ETHBRET, this was one I was going to deploy into. Over. [01:00]Over on Aerodrome on VFAT. Now I showed a $30,000 allocation with towards the end, like I am going to be dropping my allocation towards BRET. [01:10]Now my thought is I can scale into this with like 5k total and just use those percentages. Um, there's 4k in BRET, 6k in SPEC, which would be about 33%. [01:18]Um, and then there was about, uh, 20k in ETHUSDC. So we're going to start with the ETHUSDC. This is a super tight range one. [01:26]I really just want to see how it does. It's supposed to be an income position, basically. So we're going to deploy into that. [01:33]So how I'm going to start with that obviously is I'm going to head over here to YIELD. Sorry, I'm still getting used to VFAT. [01:41]And I'm really testing this out because I literally have never used this before. Um, we're going to go over to Aerodrome and BASE. [01:48]And we are going to do ETH. We're going to look at ETHUSDC. Make sure APRs. Bruh. What do you, oh that's not the concentrated liquidity one. [01:59]I'm like, what do you mean 20%? Are you kidding me? Um, and then the range we were going to do was minus 3 plus 5, so minus 3 plus 5, just like that. [02:08]That's going to give us a little bit more ETH. Um, by the way, really good price point. Like I'm, I hate to say it, but I'm thankful for the dip that we saw today. [02:16]ETH is down 8%! Entering into this position right now, absolutely golden. Matter of fact, I'm going to go buy some ETH over on Coinbase right now. [02:25]So yeah, my portfolio is up 6.3, so I'm just gonna buy like uh, and I hate doing this, but it's the ease of use that I like, because look, I'm going to get.31 ETH, so I'm effectively paying 31.61 when the market price is 31.22. [02:47]But oh well, you know, because ETH can do a lot better. Um, but yeah, I mean, if you're going to buy larger amounts, like if I was buying 5K, of course I'm going to go over on a DEX. [02:55]This is like it more of a dollar cost average Let's get back into V fat because I know I could get distracted here. [03:01]It's the beauty of ADHD. Um, I'm going to deploy two thirds of that in. So I have 79.53 over here. [03:11]I probably want to do a total of 8,000. So let me pull up that spreadsheet that I have. Okay. So if I were to just do capital allocation equals that divided by that CR5 and then we are going to put that as well. [03:31]Boom. And then we were to just do that times the CR5. Look at this. Going some crazy formulas. And we were to do that as $8,000 because I could do $8,000. [03:46]That's going to be about, one second, $1,000 in the bret. Fifty, let's just do 5,000 ETHUSDC. So we're going to keep It's simple, 5,000 ETH USDC, or as much my VFAT.
