[0:00]Okay, time to take a look at my portfolio, see how we're currently doing. So, first things first, I want to talk about Wrapped Bitcoin Dematic. [0:08]This is doing 50% APR, while this is great, I might end up getting out of it. Mainly because I have been moving into a little bit more risky stuff, completely taking on some risk as long as that risk is diversified. [0:20]Umm, but I might also just keep it because it is doing 50% on Bitcoin and Matic and I'm relatively happy with that. [0:26]So, let's go and take a look at results. Deposited $14,950, currently have $15,122. That makes 170 bucks profit from price action. [0:36]With that price profit comes $66 in impermanent loss, but we have $200 in earnings to outweigh that impermanent loss. So this one, once again, do it pretty good. [0:45]I'm just getting a little bit greedy. I think I probably will stay in this position though for a little bit longer. [0:48]It brings me out to an overall profit of $370, been deposited for about 9.7 days, 50% APR. Pretty satisfied with that orca rendered a soul. [0:58]I deposited 72 34. I now have $8,400 that is great. That puts me at a 10% profit on the overall position because I have $360 in earnings. [1:10]Now remember, not as worried about impermanent loss in this one, but ideally I still want to outperform that impermanent loss. [1:15]Here I have $207 in impermanent loss, but I do have $360 of earnings to outweigh that once again. I also have $11.71 of price profit, brings me out to an overall profit of $15.30 in just the time span of 9 days. [1:28]That's great. 200% APR. Moving further, stuff that I just entered are going to be these three right here, and I want to mention all of this right here is borrowed capital. [1:37]Meaning I am borrowing against my RAP Staked Ethereum, my RAP Bitcoin, my Staked Avax, my MaticX, all those different assets I am borrowing against, okay? [1:46]So on Orca, I have USDC to USDT, positive 98.41, obviously that's worth 98.50, so a little bit of price profit right there. [1:53]Uhh, that's probably not that big of a deal whatsoever, we're not going to bother about impermanent loss because that doesn't matter either. [1:59]Earnings, I have $7 in earnings so far, which doesn't seem like a lot, but when we put that as an APR, that's a 27% APR, so I'd be relatively happy with that. [2:08]Over on Trader Joe, I'd apologize. As of $5,006, I now have $5,020. Once again, not worried about that. What I'm worried about is earnings. [2:15]I also have $7 of earnings over on Trader Joe, which is funny because it's the exact same number. This puts me at a 52% APR on here. [2:24]Once again, very very good. Aerodrome. This is LUSD to USDC. I have $7 of earnings, puts me at a 53% APR. [2:33]So once again, these three positions right here are borrowed capital, meaning that I actually only have $24,000 of non-borrowed capital in DeFi, but since I'm leveraged in my blue chip assets, I have $45k, which is great. [2:45]Uhm, and that borrowed capital is not going to fluctuate because it is in stablecoins. That's a 74% APR, which is awesome on the overall portfolio. [2:53]I want to go and mention that I'm probably going to play, uhm, and I, and part of this is you know, maybe $4,000 or so of this like, $20,000 something thousand, $21,000, I think it is, is actually own capital. [3:05]Uhm, but the other thing is, I'm going to inject some of my own capital, like $5,000 more for my bank account or maybe $10,000 more for my bank account and do other positions. [3:15]Now this spreadsheet does not include my huddle portfolio, I am going to include my huddle portfolio on here pretty soon, but I'll keep you guys updated on that.
