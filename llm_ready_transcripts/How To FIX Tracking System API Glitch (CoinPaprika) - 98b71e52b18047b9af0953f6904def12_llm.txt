[0:00]Hey guys, so a couple things I want to go over just in regards to the tracking system It has been having issues with the Quinn gecko API as well, so I've reverted back to Quinn paprika It seems like all these rates are actually the correct rate. [0:14]I think just like once or twice I had a period Where very briefly it was displaying the wrong price and like whoa, whoa, whoa, you know, I just caught at the wrong time Um, so I would switch it back to Quinn paprika All you're gonna have to do is like copy and paste all this stuff So like for example[0:28], we'd go into the tracking sheet. We would copy and paste this whole row right here Just like that boom and then we would go through and we'd put in the coin paprika tag So we'll head over to coin paprika calm Just like this and then for Bitcoin we'll click Bitcoin and we'll grab BTC dash Bitcoin right[0:47]there That's the tag and then if we're doing it for let's just say an altcoin Let's say like rio or something like that realio network We would go and we would grab this tag and we would paste that in right here. [1:01]And then we'd also call this rio, baby Basically, and then boom that's gonna pull the accurate price information and so great stuff there. [1:09]Hopefully this will be a lot better reason Why I haven't like been laser focused determined on trying to find the best Possible like API and everything like that is because we are working on like a software like Dedicated for tracking this stuff as opposed to having to use manual spreadsheets basically[1:25]and the software will be even more automated than this will be but it will also support like Custom liquidity pools like liquidity pools that don't necessarily have What do you call it support like right now? [1:36]We support a lot of different decentralized exchanges using one that's not on that list of decentralized exchanges You'll still be able to add it in it'll just be manual updates basically, but yeah
