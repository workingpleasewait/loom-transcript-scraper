[00:00]Alright, so obviously a pretty big dip yesterday and today I was actually like at my parents house, and I was like on my phone buying Bitcoin buying aetherium. [00:09]I'll show you my buys in just a little bit on the bitcoins at 54 We went all the way down below 50 now keep in mind I don't know what exchange was tracking below 50, but it's showing 49 2 to 1 on coin gecko I didn't see anything about that, but you know I could be wrong. [00:23]We're at 54 right now Which isn't too bad um and then over here on aetherium? let's take a look we buy 2171 we're currently at 2400 some of these community calls uhm you know that like hey price moved up set an all time high right we go down we set a low basically uhm and then we go up we set a lower[01:12]high and then we set a lower low and then we set a lower high what's next a lower low basically that's three trends right there so you could say we could bounce off the three trends but that's basic technical analysis we can most definitely keep going I think we're we're seeing all this before the election[01:29], and it's not just the election, it's about about macroeconomics, if we take a look at the S&P 500, S&P 500 is down 2.7% today over the past five days 5% over the past one month 6.5% it's a pretty big crash for the S&P 500 Japan stock market ah Japan stock market is getting you know brutally killed[01:54]basically One sec, okay, it's down 12.4% today. 15% in the past five days, 23% in the past month, that's pretty bad, uhm and if we were to take a look over at, not apple. com, apple stock let's just say, apple stock over the past month 7.29% if we were to take a look over at Google stock over the past[02:16]month 14.6% if we were to take a look over at Tesla, and I'll get to NVIDIA in just a second, 20% on Tesla, NVIDIA, NVIDIA is down 20% in the past month, uhm. [02:30]Breathe in. Let's take a deep look over at Microsoft, and we'll take a look over at ah, what do you call it, Amazon, 15%, Amazon, uhm, and then down 20%. [02:40]So the tech market's getting hit in general, right, and tech market's naturally more volatile, just keep that in mind, uhm, but yeah, I believe this is just a huge effect of the broader economic, uhm, market and macroeconomics, especially in the United States, and there's gonna be chop leading up to[02:54]the election, But with that being said, right, we're currently August 5th, let's kind of map it out and what that timeline could look like. [03:02]If we zoom out and we look at the past one year, basically, you could see from bottom, right here, 59, all the way up to our peak, this lower high, basically, when I say that, to 70, we basically went from May 1st, 2024, to June 5th, 2024, a little over a month right here, basically. [03:22]So if we take a look over at this, July 7th, all the way up until, uhm, July 28th, so that was a little less than a month, about 20 days, uhm, and if we see that same exact trend, we could be about a month from now, that'd be September 5th, uhm, which wouldn't put us too far out from the election, and[03:37]if we see two months of chop slash decent volatility, uh, before the election, that would be my kind of scenario, or we could throw in another one of these swings where we go up and then we go and we set a lower low. [03:51]I am not a predictor of the crypto market, I'm not a technical analysis expert, there's no way to predict what exactly is going to happen, uhm, but yeah, I mean, you take a look at some of these tokens, greatbye as I mentioned, I have some buys, I'll go ahead and show you those, and then I will dive[04:05]into my positions. Okay, so I currently have 28.9 in Coinbase, now I want to go ahead and show you what this looks like over time, uh, or what this kind of looks like overall, so let's look at the all time chart. [04:20]I'm actually down 2.7k all time, and invested about 31.6k, uhm, so yeah, that's, that's not horrible, although at one point in time I had like 35K in here. [04:31]Up like 15,000 or so, that was when Solana was like peaking and everything like that, I think the problem is I sold a decent amount of Solana for Matic, because I was really bullish on Matic, and I still am really bullish on Matic. [04:45]They just need to get it together. I don't know what they need to do, but they need to start pumping. [04:50]But basically everything being down, that puts me down 2.2K or so. I'm currently holding about 6K of Sol over here, 3.5K Polygon, 3.5K ETH, 3.2K, 2K Bitcoin, 2.5 Link, 2.2 Render. [05:06]So let's take a look over at my transactions, because I've kind of executed a couple transactions. We'll take a look at the buys, basically. [05:15]So, as you can see, yesterday I bought Link, this was $250 of Link. Remember my Coinbase 1 waived my Coinbase fees, but there's always a spread on Coinbase. [05:27]See, spread $2.50. cents so that's how much I lost to the spread. It's not saying there's $2.50 tacked on top of that, just how much I lost to the spread. [05:38]So $9.90. Taking a look over at Link, we're at $9.80. And we bottomed out at a price of basically $8.15. [05:48]So I basically bought around like right over here essentially. Not a bad entry, right? That's about when I bought my Ethereum as well.
