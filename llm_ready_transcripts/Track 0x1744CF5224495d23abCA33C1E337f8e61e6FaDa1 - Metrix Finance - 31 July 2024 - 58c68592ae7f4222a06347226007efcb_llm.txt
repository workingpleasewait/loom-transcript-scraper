[0:00]Alright team, we're in a hat today because I actually just got my hair permed, so back to the curls. Um, but yeah, it looks like a squirrel's nest right now because you can't wash your hair for like 48 hours after getting it done. [0:12]Um, so we're going with the hat today, but anyways, to dive into the DeFi side of things. Uh, by the way, tomorrow, go register for this event, go RSVP. [0:20]I'm gonna be doing a portfolio rebalance live and do my status update, uh, position update, everything like that. Uh, so go register, uh, basically. [0:28]Now, here's the thing. This spec to Ethereum position has not got rebalanced once, and this is like my tight range position that has an automation on it. [0:37]This is doing 80% APR, right? If you look at the price, straight sideways. Now, the thing is, I can run this same exact position over on Aerodrum and get a much higher return. [0:47]Uh, as you can see, I'm doing 280% here with a similar range, uh, my range being roughly 395 to 445. [0:54]Over here, my range is roughly 315 to 571. So this is a break. Uhm, but I can run this same exact position over on VFAT, get a better, better return, uhm, and that will get me to actually having my, my, uhm, capital, you know, in this position back quicker because I would have had, uhm, you know, a much[1:17]higher earnings that can then go and compound and so, uhm, so yeah, I'm pretty happy with that, but as far as like the overall portfolio goes, it does need a rebalance. [1:24]We're doing 32% APR here, not too good. I want to allocate some more, uhm, to these VFAT positions. I just got to dive into actual performance of these, uhm, because yes, they're all at an overall profit, like I started with 79.50, uhm, and then also I pulled out a ton of daily rewards, so yeah, but[1:41]that rebalance is going to be happening live tomorrow. I am going to write down some notes and everything, get things ready, uhm, before rebalancing tomorrow, so do keep that in mind. [1:49]Just show up to that call. I'm going to be going over the rebalance, actually rebalancing things, uhm, and then yeah, going over like performance and everything like that. [1:56]Uh, these are really good APRs over here over on VFAT. Now, with that being said. If you guys didn't know, Metrix Finance switched over to WAP instead of Google Authentication, uhm, what does this mean for you? [2:07]Well, essentially, whenever you go to log in, it's just like you're logging into Google, basically, uhm, it's just, you know, an extra step. [2:14]Instead of directing you straight to Google, it will say, oh, you need to sign in, and with WAP, you can sign in through Google, if you want to, or you can sign in with uhm, Apple, or you can sign in with literally any other sign up method, or just do your email, basically, so you, you know, normal person[2:29]can go and just sign in with like Google, basically, like they were on Metrix before, uhm, whereas if you're a new person, you want to use your normal email, you can do that over here, uh, you can also change your email for WAP in the WAP settings, uhm, you can also sign in with a wallet address, which[2:44]is pretty cool, uh, that's one of the reasons why we switched to WAP, because we can focus on building new features while having wallet address functionality for signing in, uh, as well as paying with cryptocurrency, so. [2:55]Now, with that being said, I want to show you what we're kind of building over on WAP as well, because WAP, it facilitates like payments on a lot of The but it also allows you to like host private Discord communities, host, uhm, private courses, private groups, we're not switching, uhm, app. builderwap. com[3:09]over there, because it's not as good as Circle, in my opinion, quite yet, it has its, you know, good functionality, uhm, but we're basically over on, on Metrix Finance WAP, uh, there's like a announcements tab, where we're posting all the new, like, features and everything like that, whenever we post[3:25]like an update or push an update, you'll be able to see everything that we did right over here, so that way you can quickly see, oh, I need do X, Y, Z, or something like that. [3:32]You'd also drop your suggestions over here, uhm, you could create support tickets, or you can access what we're, or our, our free Discord, but you have Metrix Pro, you're gonna get access to this basically, but essentially, it's like, the overall goal is to like teach you how to use Metrix Pro, so I've[3:52], like, haven't recorded anything, but this is what it's gonna be, basically, uhm, so I'm excited for that. Now, while we're on the topic of courses, so metrics pro is gonna come second. [4:01]Uhm, over on Builder Wealth, we are building an Aerodrome Yield Farming course over here, basically, uhm, this will be available for $47 for purchase, uh, for anybody, but Builder Wealth clients are obviously gonna get access for free, uh, this is not done yet, but I'm hoping to have this done within[4:19]one to two days, uhm, so yeah, get excited for that, that will be hosted over on WAP as well, uhm, and the reason why is because over on app. builderwealth. com, over here, I wanna keep all this stuff, You basically like constantly updated, like we still have this UniSwa V3 Mini Course and this Salona[4:36]Yield Farming Course, I mean the concepts are outdated, they're, they're accurate, but they're outdated, you know what I mean, we're still using Builder Metrics in this, uhm, but people paid for this and we can't just delete it, uhm, because people want it there, but at the same time, it's in here, obviously[4:50]you guys are also gonna have access to it, so, uhm, having that taken out, but put over on WAP, you guys can get access to it if you wanted to get access to it, But just know it's like an archived, kind of an older version.
