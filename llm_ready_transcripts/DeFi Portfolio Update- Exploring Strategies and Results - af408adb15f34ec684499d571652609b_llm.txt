[0:00]Okay, I want to go ahead and show you guys exactly what I'm doing in DeFi. Quick mention, I am going to be using this new tracking system. [0:06]I'm currently kind of testing things out just to see how this functions. Uh, and I'm not going to release it quite yet. [0:12]And the reason why I'm not going to release it quite yet is because I want to make sure that there are no glitches. [0:17]There's no issues or anything like that. And then you guys have to completely read it. Do input in your positions because it will take a migration from the old tracking system to the new one. [0:25]I'm trying to work on like a seamless integration with that as well. Um, but yeah, this will be released pretty soon hopefully. [0:30]I'm just testing it out. I literally set it up last night. But as you can see, my portfolio value $50,412. [0:36]This does not include my USD plus to uh OVNC. Token position in here and portfolio value is essentially all your position values plus the unclaimed fees that you have basically. [0:48]So do keep that in mind. Now, liquidity is what we actually have in the pool right now, whereas deposits is how much we actually deposited into the pool. [0:56]Withdrawals obviously that would show there if there were withdrawals. I don't have any withdrawals. I will say setting up positions that have multiple deposits and multiple withdrawals, there are some limitations just like the last tracking sheet. [1:07]I'm working on solving those, but we're also going to be implementing into our software where it's easily solvable basically. Um, but yeah, moving on, as you can see, I have some earnings on some of these different positions. [1:16]Very low on this Matic2USDC one, but it's doing a 45% APR. That's because I opened this position literally like yesterday afternoon basically, it hasn't even been 24 hours. [1:26]Um, but let's dive into some of this top stuff. Earnings, this is total earnings right here. It also shows that as a percentage of how much you deployed basically. [1:34]Um, and then additionally, it shows unclaimed earnings. So this is like, okay, I have 616 pending. I've got 2 cents that I claimed, which I think is inaccurate. [1:42]I just forgot to, um, adjust a number over here or something like that, uh, because I don't actually have 2 cents of claimed earnings. [1:51]But, um, yeah, let's move forward. Basically, profit loss, this is going to be your overall profit loss expressed as a percentage as well. [1:57]Versus HODL, this is since you're gonna add the fees that you have. To the impermanent loss that you have, basically. [2:03]So, over here, if we look at, like, MATIC to USDC, it's gonna show versus HODL is $9.21. It's because I have $11.13 of fees, and I have $1.90 of impermanent loss, or, as expressed here, divergence loss, basically. [2:17]We're gonna start to use the term divergence loss. It's a better term to represent. And then, if we take a look over here, asset gain, negative $1,000. [2:24]That's how much I lost just from the price moving down, basically. So, it's actually an asset loss. Expresses a percentage that's about 2% or so. [2:32]Uhm, keep in mind, this does not factor in my fees. This is the one that factors in my fees. Overall portfolio APR, 70%. [2:38]24-hour projection, 99%. 85% or $95 per day. That's great. Uh, one-month projection, around $28.92 per month. Now, in this scenario that I was including my OVN to USD Plus, I'm probably doing about $110 per day, basically. [2:52]So, that's exactly how you can see like the roll-up of everything. But now, I want to dive into some specific positions and kind of outline what exactly I'm doing. [2:59]Thank you. First things first, I have this MATIC to USDC position. This one is on QuickSwap. It was doing roughly a 58% return when I simulated on QuickSwap. [3:07]Uh, after about a day, first impressions are about 45%, so not too far off. And we have been seeing a little bit of a decline in volume. [3:14]So, I am fine with those numbers, because that's also better than what I was doing over on Uniswap. Taking a look over at this position, it currently has a range of roughly.58 to roughly.79 basically. [3:27]MATIC is trading at 68 cents. I am considering rebalancing this one after a couple days if the yield does not pick up. [3:33]I'll just bring down that max price a little bit to probably something like 75 cents, and then I'll bring up that min price to something like 60 cents.
