[0:00]Hey guys, I wanted to pop on here tell you a little bit about yielder And I just want to give a full disclaimer right off the bat yielder did fund my deposit into this Position that I currently have on their platform, but with that being said I'm gonna be fully transparent with you guys Also gonna be[0:13]fully transparent on YouTube really just keep you guys updated with how This performs so use my deposit which is essentially risk free on me as an example to see how this kind of performs how it works the other thing I will say is I am gonna keep you guys updated if I do decide to make an additional[0:27]deposit of my own capital in this platform now with that being said this is essentially a platform that allows you to leverage your uniswap v3 positions or of course borrow against it now Yielder itself has not been audited quite yet they do have an audit underway however they are a fork of obv3 which[0:44]essentially means that ob has been audited obv is saved the only thing that would be unsafe here is of course the additions that Yielder made which is allowing collabular uniswap v3 positions or even allowing you to leverage up on uniswap v3 positions now with that being said there's this market section[1:00]there's supply as well as borrow apy now essentially what you can also do is go and lend out your uniswap v3 positions so that way you can borrow against them and when youre lending out uniswap v3 positions youre essentially collatalizing them nobody is actually borrowing your position youre just collatalizing[1:14]your uniswap v3 position so you can borrow different stablecoins this has been official if you have like a large wrapped at coin to eth position with say a million bucks in it and you want to get like $300,000 to go through unstablecoins as well to kind of leverage up in a sense but in a safe manner[1:27]you could do that the thing i will say though is the market is a relatively low size it currently sits at $100,000 as well as some interest rates where borrowers are super high occasionally like at one point they're like 20 percent which was just not profitable so do keep that in mind now with that being[1:43]said essentially what they're doing when you leverage up they're collateralizing your uni-swap v3 position so they essentially put it here as collateral and then they're allowing you to borrow usdc or borrow whatever asks that and they take that asset that you borrow convert it to the proper ratio and[1:57]invest into lending and borrowing platform itself has has Let's begin. Ughh ughh.85% especially on like a dead of 1700 that's not bad so this is a very very interesting platform i did make a youtube video explaining all the mechanics behind this but once again i'm gonna keep you guys updated i just wanna[2:53]go and show case this platform so if you guys wanna look into it you can once again not telling you the deposit section if you guys wanna look is actually saved and then of course this is a great platform the Uniswap v3 community where people can borrow against Uniswap positions but of course those things[3:22]do need to happen in order for that to happen essentially and I do think that more money will inflow once they do get audit so yeah that's my thoughts.
