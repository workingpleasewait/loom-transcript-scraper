[0:00]Okay, so market's up a decent amount today, which is why I'm upset that those positions got rebalanced I haven't touched them quite yet, but now these ones are actually at a profit $8.76 overall I have $97 of earnings $87 versus HODL so that tells me that there's about $10 of impermanent loss within[0:17]these positions not too bad now That's a given considering that these positions are super super broad range. I mean over here there's $1.38 and then there's $22 in earnings, which is really nice But 17% APR, I'd rather get a much higher APR over here on this UCT TON one Currently the price of TON is[0:37]at roughly $7.30. So once again, I wish this one didn't give me Rebounced because it just locked in all that impermanent loss for basically nothing Um, but $8.50. [0:47]I have $24 of earnings And then take me look over at the other one is Spec ETH. So let's see how this one's performing. [0:57]This one has about 14 cents of divergence Gain, which shouldn't be that that's just telling us that there's about zero dollars of divergence gain Um, and the only reason why it shouldn't positive number is because different price oracles. [1:09]So do keep that in mind Um, and yeah, I mean this is at $50 overall profit compared to HODL Um, so yeah, if these didn't get rebalanced, these would still be doing really really good. [1:18]They did get rebalanced It's not much that we can do there for future rebalances. I am going to test out crystal. [1:23]Um, they have a decent tracking tool. I can now say that because we have metrics metrics track out there. Um, they have a decent tracking tool, but I haven't tried out there. [1:33]Um, you know, actual like position rebalancing or anything like that or automations, which I guess it's time to give them a try. [1:39]Um, and kind of see how that goes. But I'm hoping that Aputure can eventually fix this. Uh, but yeah, I'll keep you guys updated with how things perform. [1:47]I actually do want to go ahead and dive into a 51 talk about performance over here. So give me a sec. [1:53]I've made $42 so far, which on $3,500 of capital, it's like $1,000. That's 1.2% so far, and that's over the course of let's just say 3 days, if we multiply that by $3.65, it's about 150% APR overall, which is pretty solid. [2:10]The worst performing one is this ETHlink one, which is kind of a given, it's on the Arbitrum network, but just really to see how this actually works compared to HODL, hasn't even had to rebalance yet. [2:20]But yeah, I'll keep you guys posted with how these actually do, it actually looks like this one's getting a Merkle APR as well, and I'm wondering if I could just go directly over to Merkle and claim that return, so let's try that out, because this is definitely a consideration over here, it looks like[2:40]you can do that, so that's great, uhm, it's great to hear because that will definitely boost the overall APR, but yeah, so far these are pretty good, I'll let you guys know once I make a track and change.
