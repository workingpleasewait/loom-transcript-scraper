[]Hey guys, so we are going to be creating a roadmap, kind of like DeFi Formula. I know a lot of you guys have enjoyed DeFi Formula ]Uhm, but we're going to be creating one specifically for stablecoin liquidity pools. It'll start off with, uh, using DeFi Llama, and eventually once we refine our, uh, systems at Metrix Finance to better support stablecoins, uhm, then of course we'll dive into Metrix Finance ]But for now, we'll just go over what we have. Uhm, I want to walk you guys through the layout. This is plan that I have, just so you guys can critique it, give me feedback before I go and record a bunch of lessons ]Uh, it will focus on Delta Neutral LPs as well. So we'll start off by just explaining the difference, stable LPs versus Delta Neutral ]We'll dive into setting your goals, creating your allocation timeline, just like we did in Formula. Then we'll evaluate safe stablecoins, kind of get a list of them before we dive in, make sure they're collateralized ]Uhm, we'll share our stability portfolio blueprints, so that way the community can provide feedback with it. We'll have a framework specifically for finding stable LPs over on DeFi Llama, determining the ranges for those stable LPs, validating them, making sure that they're good investments, uhm, finding[]Delta Neutral liquidity pools, uh, using a specific framework. We'll use Metrix Finance for this, cause you're hedging, uh, and what places to hedge, determining ranges for the Delta Neutral LPs, simulating Delta Neutral LP performance, validating them ]Uh, constructing a portfolio map of like your allocations everywhere, then sharing that with the community. Then in the launch phases, obviously double checking everything, including stable coins and positions, making sure they're collateralized, not de-pegged or anything like that ]Simulating the portfolio performance, deploying the capital, and then sharing the portfolio, so we can all provide feedback. And then in managing, tracking the performance, we'll probably use a spreadsheet here to start off with ]Maybe we'll have a, uh, software tool that you guys can use. Thank Creating a compounding flywheel for compounding your stable coin income and growing your portfolio over time ]Uh, different types of rebalancing in stability portfolios is what we're going to call this. And then when to rebalance those stable LPs, when to rebalance delta neutral LPs, sharing the stability performance, all that stuff ]And then for optimizing, increasing your time and range, refining your hedging strategy, injecting more capital, and sharing your optimization. So, let me know what you guys think ]Let me know what you guys have, uh, and I'm happy to start working on this.
