[0:00]So, running a delta neutral strategy over here on Fartcoin and Sol. I actually brought this example up before, but, uhm, it's pretty cool. [0:10]So, we have a $95 loss right over here. We're doing a 245% APR. Uhm, we have $20 in income so far. [0:17]Uh, if you look at it, we've already seen assets shift from 54% Fartcoin to 58% Fartcoin. Uhm, and then over here on Radium, you'll notice that we have a $175 profit. [0:28]So, why do we have the $175 profit? Well, because this Fartcoin position is up 40% and the Sol position is up 12%, right? [0:37]Obviously, we're using leverage here. Uh, I believe it's 3X leverage or so. Uhm, I will say it's very, very finicky on Radium. [0:44]I honestly, somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but I honestly don't think you can choose the leverage for a single position. [0:51]Basically, what I was noticing is as I turn up this, it would adjust my leverage. So, you see, it's like 3.48. Over here, it's like 4.93. But this is also what determines the amount of, like, Sol or Fartcoin that I'm shorting, which is rather odd. [1:04]So, I literally had to deposit some for the Fartcoin, and then I had to execute the Fartcoin, uh, trade, and then I had to deposit more. [1:12]For the Sol, and then execute the Sol trade. I had to do it separately. It was really a pain, because I couldn't find a place to change the leverage. [1:19]Now, I did see Account Leverage over here, uh, where I could go and adjust this, but this is just Max Account Leverage. Uhm, so, yeah, I mean, it's just rather annoying. [1:28]And it looks like maybe it's doing leverage, you know, on the whole portfolio or something like that. I don't know. [1:33]It doesn't seem that great of a tool. So, I would use other tools and other options. Other exchanges, if I could. [1:37]Uhm, but, yeah, I mean, with that being said, I didn't want to go over to, like, Mexi or something like that and have to deal with centralization. [1:44]Uhm, but, with that being said, though, I mean, obviously, 190 bucks in this instance outweighs the, you know, the $100 loss that I have in this position or so. [1:53]Or, wait, now it's $131. Anyways, we are covered, uhm, which is good. But, like, we're generating income over here at $250. So, if you were to do the math over here and look at, kind of, my capital contributions. [2:06]So, we currently have $6,053 right over here on the pool. And then, we have $21.85 right over here. Uhm, so, we're just going to go ahead and add these two together. [2:17]My total capital, $82.40, okay? And then, if my projection is to make, basically, $15,000 a year, right there, we divide that by that, that's 186% APR on a delta-neutral position, basically. [2:32]And that's, like, strictly fees. It's not including any price-profit we get on the way down. Uhm, another thing about this strategy is I did over-short Fartcoin on purpose, though. [2:41]Uhm, basically, like, I'm under the, you know, impression that the markets continue to go down, basically. Uhm, so, Uhm, and if it continues to go down, well, then Fartcoin is going to significantly underperform Sol. [2:53]Uh, and if it goes up, like, yeah, it might over-perform Sol, we might be over-shorted. Uh, but my thought is that fees are gonna outweigh any difference right there, because they're gonna build up pretty quickly over time. [3:02]Uh, we're expecting to do about $42 per day, at least that's what we're on track for. So, I'll keep you guys up-to-date on this position.
