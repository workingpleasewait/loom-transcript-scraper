[0:00]Okay, so I posted a performance update literally last night and basically when I did this I was still down 12-12 on my positions essentially um But up 11-12 from HODL, which is basically all profit right Market has done substantially good today, right? [0:18]The market's done really really nice. I'm really excited But obviously don't get your hopes up because we might not be out of the gutter quite yet, right? [0:24]We could easily see another big dump, especially before the election And then go down to an even lower low and if that's the case I am deploying man. [0:33]I don't even care I'm deploying But definitely could have got some good trades in I think I did get like one or two good trades where I just like Bought a couple thousand bucks Like kind of over at this area this area ish. [0:44]I know I didn't hit bottom, but I got a decent trade in Probably about 59,000 per Bitcoin. I think or 60,000 um But yeah, I mean we can easily go back up kind of like there go to the 66 level or so and then boom right back down um You know down to like uh Level that is around 52 or so. [1:03]I would say is relatively reasonable 52 53 um But yeah, that's that I wanted to quickly show you a portfolio update and then right after this I'm going to um Go and do a live rebalance of spec ETH basically also quick little thing. [1:17]I think I'm actually gonna merge all the um exclusive Videos like this exclusive video section into community due diligence and just all these um little community channels because they seem more in place And they're my personal opinion and a lot of people complain that there's like so many like tabs[1:32]It's like which one do I go to you know, um, which is reasonable, you know, I know where everything's at But again, I'm the one that does everything here, you know, but again if you want to get the latest And greatest just go to the home section. [1:42]You'll be able to see everything This is everything rolled up into one and you can see trending post and everything, which is great So yeah, just check that out. [1:49]By the way doing an AMA with radium go RSVP if you can make it Super excited for this the billion dollar guests guys. [1:55]Um, they're gonna cover some great alpha there Um, let's dive into the actual position So yeah, I mean I'm up on these current positions 1847 total, which is great. [2:05]I deployed 41 266. I have 41 817 So I'm at 550 and asset gain and I'm at 1200 Versus huddle because I'm factoring in the 1295 and fees and as you can see I literally have about a hundred bucks of divergence loss really really really good on and something else that I want to go ahead and mention is that's[2:24]about a 5% return on investment which isn't bad whatsoever on and then as far as like projections go I'm getting a 40% APR but let me show you my range on spec and I'll show you what I'm doing a live rebalance on 60% APR like man I'm just staying in the spec pool to on to get you know my my initial assets[2:41]back even though it's a lower return if I go to simulate pool right here which keep in mind we now filled the deposit amount we filled the price when you do this dude I mean look at this look at this minus 66% plus 105% like this is the broadest range ever cause I had one of those APR auto rebalances[2:58]where it would just get a wider range whenever the price went to a specific point and I had time to rebalance and I kinda like was kicking it cause I was doing like 90% APR but that APR went down over time so I'm like ok I need to rebalance now that it's doing about 60% APR I definitely need to rebalance[3:12]cause if I can get this to 150% and maybe I rebalance ETH link as well to get to like 50% that is golden like I'm gonna do really well on that one. [3:20]Uhm and this doesn't factor in the BP position I'll tell you guys our plan over the next couple days for like new features and everything but soon we'll have like custom and everything uhm but yeah let me pull up the BP position so you guys can see uhh one second here it's the OVN to USD plus one. [3:40]I'm not sure why it's not showing that but let's take a look over here I know for a fact I haven't exited it uh but I'll go ahead and pause this while we wait okay simple little glitch had to disconnect then reconnect to my wallet but I'm at a $900 profit that is really good uhm once again OVN token[3:56]I'm waiting for that thing to kick back up once that thing kicks back up and by the way it is back. [4:00]not correlated to the market really whatsoever it's at $38 I mean we look at the past 3 months it looks like there's just big whale dumps that are controlling the price so I mean this might be something I want to get out of but again my instinct is telling me maybe I should stay in uhm another thing[4:15]I could do is pull out like deposit leave a couple grand basically just leave the yield that was in there uhm that's one scenario that I could do I don't know uh you know maybe I'll pull out like half of it or something I'll keep you guys updated with what I do I definitely believe in this but also and[4:31]it's doing a high return but also at the same time when you see it go from you know $86 boom within the time span of like oh I guess this is the time span of like a couple weeks but like I'm talking like these days mainly where we go from $54 right down to like $44 you know what I mean and instantly[4:47]drop like a huge amount that just like begs the question okay what's going on here uhm we can actually dive a little bit deeper into this we might as well dive a little bit deeper into this uhm bigger trades and stuff like that we did OVN to USD plus top traders we can kind of see what's going on so[5:04]this person over here is at a $730 profit loss uhm but they don't even have any buys that are being shown uhm this person's at a $300k profit loss $858k buys this person's at a $158k profit loss so there's a lot of people at a profit here uhm so yeah I mean that's kind of like a consideration I guess[5:23]these are whales uh and then if we take a look over at transactions we can do basically big buys if we want to sort the US dollar greater than $10,000 you could see there's big buys coming in each day I want to do a $100,000 just in see what that brings up it's like yeah I mean we have when we do above
