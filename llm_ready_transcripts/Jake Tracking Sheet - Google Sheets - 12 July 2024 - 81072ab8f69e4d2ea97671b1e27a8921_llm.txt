[00:01]Okay, so I hope you guys are in for a long video, because I'm gonna be rebalancing my kind of hedge position, uh, that I have on GammaSwap basically. [00:11]So, first things first, I wanna tell you the strategy. So, I essentially have this position, it's a 50-50 position, I'm yield farming on GammaSwap. [00:19]This is getting a crazy 8% PR, right, on ETHUSDC, way better than a full range position. Here's the caveat to that, right? [00:26]If I said that right, here's the twist, um, here's the catch, right? Uhm, but basically, I am getting escrowed ARB tokens, so I have to go and I have to vest those ARB tokens, which means I can't just go and sell them instantly with the ARB price continuously going up. [00:40]Going down, or whatever, or if it does continue to go down, well guess what? That's not in my best interest. [00:45]That's not great. Uh, if we look at the past three months, it does not look pretty. Uh, we are at all-time lows, basically, for ARB token right now. [00:52]Uhm, so just like a consideration there. But with that being said, the other thing that I want to go ahead and mention is I can hedge out those ARB tokens, but I haven't really got to a point where I have, you know, really dove in and started to try to actually hedge out these ARB tokens. [01:07]Uhm, now here's the thing. I am essentially, since this is a 50-50 position, I'm hedging out all Impermanent Loss Exposure. [01:17]I'm not hedging out Price Exposure, Which means, if I lose ten ARB dollars to Impermanent Loss, theoretically I should make ten dollars uhm on the hedged, on the hedge for the position, uhm, to kind of balance out that Impermanent Loss. [01:31]Now, here's the thing, right, when I initially, and I have no idea why this is not loading, uhm, when I initially invested into this pool, the, I And it was very low for that time, and then like the next day it shot up. [01:51]So, my position is actually down $46 on $110. Now, keep in mind that $110 gives me exposure to like basically $3,000 over here. [02:01]So, it's not that much in retrospect. And in this position over here, you can see I have about $90 in permanent loss. [02:09]But here's the thing, right? When we take a look at this, I got $3,061 in the pool right here. Now, when I go over to uhm, I try to make things simple. [02:20]When I go over to OV, the amount of ETH that I had borrowed to put in this position is right here, $0.9325. [02:27]That's worth $2,900 basically. So, what I'm looking at is like in permanent loss, that's negative 90. But at the same exact time, what I'm looking at is higher than this. [02:40]$2,900, right? Uh, so basically, I, the, the reason why I wanted to do it this way so I can basically track, I said, okay, I started with this much ETH. [02:49]Whatever ETH is over here, $0.9325, that's what I started with. Actually, if not, there's a little bit more. I started with a little bit less because this borrow has gone up a little bit. [02:57]You know, you accumulate more ETH in your borrow section. That's $2,900 there. So, theoretically, I did hedge out a permanent loss because I can pay back this loan, not even factoring in any of the reward tokens. [03:10]We could take out the reward tokens, and I could still pay back this loan, basically. Um, so that's something that I just wanted to go ahead and put out there. [03:17]Um, which is pretty cool, because that means I didn't lose any money on this. Uh, but, which is great, because I put up my ETH as collateral and then borrowed more ETH. [03:24]So, what I'm actually going to do is close out these positions and go and rebalance them. And I want to try this on a concentrated liquidity position, because I'm not really rocking with the escrowed ARB tokens. [03:36]Don't really want to deal with those. Um, so this was a great test. And I'm going to, I'm going to probably go with $5,000 in capital. [03:43]Um, and I'm going to keep it clean, so I'm going to walk you through that exact process. So, heading over to GammaSwap, going to launch the app, wait for this guy to load up, which sometimes it can be relatively slow. [03:56]I'm not sure why it's slow, so I'm just going to pause this. Okay, so we're back. Um, I'm I was talking to the guy at GammaSwap, they were pushing an update and I just so happened to be recording at the same time. [04:06]Uh, let's go over to the borrowed section. I am going to go ahead and close this out. So, I just went ahead and logged into my ledger.
